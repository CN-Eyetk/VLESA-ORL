  "What do you do when it happens?",
  "I absolutely do. We normally find out that we are actually much stronger than we give ourselves credit for.",
  "Sure, you can tell me anything. I won't judge or anything like that.",
  "They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet.",
  "I sometimes force myself to exercise when I get sleepy when I shouldn't be tired during the day.",
  "When I had a toxic manager I went in and did my work and kept to myself as much as possible. But it does help to have allies throughout the company too!",
  "I can tell you are very sad about this situation and understandably so. It seems as if alcohol is your coping mechanism right now correct? Do you have close friends to share your emotions with?",
  "after the exam your pressure will be less than now",
  "It sounds like you have tried a lot of different methods, so good for you for taking care of yourself. What is overwhelming you?",
  "Nearly ten pounds a pack here (UK). I am gonna try and save up for a new handbag!",
  "No, I don't find that to be healthy, and I don't enjoy them.",
  "I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you'll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet. You don't want to be with a cheater. you should want to be with someone who respects you and treats you well",
  "I think you should look into getting an advocate. You have a legal entitlement to have representation.",
  "Sure, I can see where it would be challenging and pregnancy would be scary. But I'd suggest discuss it with her doctor to see what they suggest.",
  "Why do you think that way?",
  "I try. I was working at a bookstore at minimum wage for 2 years so I totally understand where you are coming from and had coworkers that also had kids. The best advice I can give is to continue to put yourself out there and take opportunities as they come even if they are short term because the more experience you have, the easier it is to find a better job even during the pandemic.",
  "Ok. Have you thought about a plan? When you tell your family, it may help to state your planned actions. This may help with feelings of uncertainty, both theirs and yours.",
  "Tender Loving Care :) Means be good to yourself",
  "Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave.",
  "I think it can help release feelings and help ground people. Do you have family that has experienced what you are feeling or been through college o a scholarship? I would suggest reaching out to family in the case of feeling anxiety.",
  "awesome im glad",
  "I think it would be a good idea for you to try and get medical help for your depression.",
  "Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.",
  "Merry Christmas!",
  "Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately.",
  "You are a warrior and you need to fight off the worrisome and motivate yourself to help you kiddo.",
  "That's a really hard thing to be going through. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in?",
  "oh okay. Have you tried checking with your friends to see if you could meet in person but still maintain social distance and wear masks, etc.",
  "your welcome. There are a lot of online options out there. That may be easier for you at the time being without a car. Do you have a support system of family or friends around here?",
  "Youre only human, right?",
  "I can understand how angry unappreciated and burnt out you must be feeling. I would feel that way too",
  "Not bad for a Monday, but that's often a bummer of a day. What's got you down?",
  "Ok. I am happy to listen.",
  "Absolutely. The weather seems to be getting nicer as well. Do you like any outdoor activites (ex. walking outside)?",
  "Try again, you have to hit quit and fill the questionarie",
  "It's my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn't always an option.",
  "It sounds like he meant a lot to you!",
  "your welcome.",
  "Just do something you like to do to get your mind off of it",
  "that's really nice of you. i'm 800+ miles away from my parents",
  "I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?",
  "That's tough. How long have you been together?",
  "your welcome",
  "Being single does not mean you're completely alone. There are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends.",
  "I can see why you are concerned. These are certainly difficult times and this pandemic doesn't seem to be stopping anytime now. I understand your frustation.",
  "Try to take shot break or do deep breathing in middle. It will help you in staying energetic and focused.",
  "Ok. This has been going on for some time. Is it possible to discuss the matter with your manager? With HR?",
  "Your welcome I'm glad I was able to help. Is there anything else I can help you with?",
  "You are welcome. I truly believe in you and what I say. You are not alone in this. So many are struggling right now.",
  "Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on?",
  "I'm sorry you're not feeling great, what's wrong?",
  "Being upset and heartbroken is very understandable, but what do you mean by a strange complex?",
  "you hate anything don't doing, this is your life, so make it perfect",
  "What was the fight over? Food? Money? Sex?",
  "Just to make sure I understand, you recently left a job and you are feeling very anxious about it.",
  "Is there anything else I can help you with?",
  "I can understand how you are feeling.",
  "I hear you :( I've been through that too. It can be hard to break away and stand against such a thing.",
  "hope you will feel better soon.",
  "I understand, school was tough for me too.",
  "Yes, i understand what you are saying. It's really hard to move on from bad experiences, staying positive is important in these situations.",
  "When you feel up to it, do a search for temp agencies near you and hopefully they can give you some leads about a job.",
  "I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground.",
  "You're welcome, I hope you have a better understanding of the problem now.",
  "you too :)",
  "Are you employers likely to be sympathetic?",
  "Truly, everyone got to participate and pay tribute together. Virtually or not, you were all together.",
  "I can see that being a challenge feeling guilty about whether you did something to affect the relationship. But, you sound like you are really trying to make things work and maintain the friendship.",
  "Oh wow, i'm so sorry. That's really scary.",
  "Crying is good, you shouldn't bottle your emotions",
  "I would recommend giving counselling a go, even though you're not totally sure about it",
  "Being anger is valid and you have every right to be mad. You have been betrayed and have to work through problems that you didn't create. Do you have any close friends you can confide in sometimes?",
  "So it's the test anxiety that has been causing the stress.",
  "I also spend a lot of time at home. It's really a rough time",
  "What is going on?",
  "Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?",
  "Hello",
  "That sounds like a great idea! It sounds like you care a lot about your kids, I bet it's easy for you to be grateful for them :-)",
  "Is there any chance of increasing your hours? What is your relationship with your sibling like?",
  "well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?",
  "It is here company",
  "That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.",
  "What is causing the down trodden",
  "You lost your job? thats a tough situation. Is it due to covid?",
  "Are you currently working?",
  "what do you think of that",
  "Why do you feel you are depressed about it? Were you together a long time?",
  "I actually had a death in a family a few months ago as well, with a virtual funeral. I really empathize with the way you and your family are feeling. But you know, I tried to look at the virtual funeral as a way for so many people to pay tribute in a way they couldn't in person. People from all over ge t their chance to say goodbye.",
  "Okay, can you reduce any expenses? Maybe a subscription?",
  "Take care!",
  "I am so glad you have been able to look within yourself to see that you have all the resources you need to handle this period of life. You have a optimistic attitude and a can do spirit, and those will take you far!",
  "That sounds like a really difficult and uncomfortable situation to be in.",
  "Friends, family and faith are what keep us grounded. It sounds like you have all of those. Please remember that each is there to support you.",
  "Yeah, that's a good point. A little complaining is ok, but a lot can get on people's nerves.",
  "Is there any event happened the last few days that triggered your depression?",
  "you can still do that online instead of in person",
  "It sounds like this is really bothering you. It is good that you are talking about it though.",
  "I'm sorry to hear about that, have you discussed how it made you feel with your partner?",
  "Yes. Once your anxiety subsides a little do you think that the job situation might solve itself?",
  "I went through a phase of wearing only baggy clothes because I thought i was overweight. Looking back I was not but I thought I was.",
  "Wow that sounds like it has put you in a bind. I do understand cos once I had to flee from a boyfriend and was scared he would come after me.",
  "Your past is definitely not a burden, it's part of you, even if it's not a positive experience. By sharing your past, it would bring you closer as a couple.",
  "Oh that is awesome! So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?",
  "Perhaps you could make a list of the things that you have to look forward to in the New Year? It might help reassure you that things can get better.",
  "I think that you need to just totally back away from this relationship before something really bad happens. Can you try to just think that she does not exist and not obsess about her?",
  "Go you! Sounds like you've really found some gifts in all this hardship. What are some things that have brought you joy today?",
  "Well, I make sure I continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues I have available. It is definitely not the same, but it's what we have at the moment.",
  "Yes, of course it is :). So we are talking about your daughter and her husband and their child together, right?",
  "You are quite welcome. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Have a great day.",
  "Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them?",
  "That's great! Then you should not worry about anything. Now days situation is really stressful. We have to manage it somehow. You should give little time to yourself as well. It Will increase your productivity.",
  "it sounds like lack of employment has you down",
  "Well for one my house has never been so spotless ha. I have been exercising more, going for more walks with my dog, having more family nights, just anything really that can take my mind of it.",
  "I have been angry with friends as well, but time loves a hero, as they say.",
  "You need to readjust your expectations, which are causing you to feel unhappy.",
  "I am really sorry to know about that. Your partner should understand your situation.",
  "I think that might be an issue you need to deal with first. That is not an ok situation to be in.",
  "Hello - How are you today?",
  "Be Blessed for He lives inside of you",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. What do you mean you thought it was going somewhere?",
  "Perhaps it is time to try and make some new friends? Join a society or something?",
  "When I was in college, I worked for the school and the library. It was not a lot of money, but in addition to a small check, it made me more indispensable to the university.",
  "Can you elaborate? What do you mean by that?",
  "you too! (can you quit first, I can't from this end :P)",
  "Hello! How are you doing today?",
  "That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.",
  "It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself. Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups. I do it with a book club.",
  "what is making you sad?",
  "after the trip, you can start looking around and see, if there's no good openings, you can do part time to get some income for now",
  "I am really sorry to hear that. It seems to be happening to a lot of people right now. Do you have anything on the back burner?",
  "You are welcome. Good luck with your book.",
  "... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!",
  "Not in a scary, better-off-dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I'm a flea to the universe.",
  "Yes, I think that they would. Ultimately they are trained to help people who are in your situation.",
  "Try practicing meditation and yoga, and avoid mobile phones atleast an hour before you sleep. Chamomile tea also helped me relaxed before.",
  "It has been a pleasure!",
  "I can't help you if you don't talk to me darling'",
  "You can and you should get a job, so start right now!",
  "It sounds like your stressed a lot and just having a little trouble finding your way forward.",
  "I know how bad it feels but I can promise you that it will fade after time.",
  "Have you done anything different than usual while staying at home?",
  "wow, there is a lot going on for sure, I hope it assures you too know that tough times to pass.",
  "according to the search page, its caused 64 abortions",
  "Do you feel as though life is hopeless and there is no way forward?",
  "my coworker got hers this week. she had a headche, stomach ache and felt weak. maybe do a group chat so they call as see what sympotoms they all had",
  "Help in searching for jobs and supporting you emotionally",
  "ok for sure, It was nice to talk you",
  "I have had racing thoughts and it used to drive me up the wall!",
  "i can imagine how you are feeling right now, but can you explain better how the situation is?",
  "I hope you are aware about the potential vaccines with great success rate announced my major pharma companies.",
  "Typically I will search for a company and then look at the employees based on that search. If I see anyone who I have a common connection with or just something similar, I reach out.",
  "you should take a complete rest for 2-3 hours without worrying and then get up and eat something tasty and healthy. Afterwards sit for preparing for your exam. That's what I do and it helps me a lot.",
  "You're welcome! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?",
  "just strictly told them to do study 1st and got a good mark then only you will give them their phones.",
  "your welcome goodnight",
  "I can understand how you feel. It is very difficult",
  "You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!",
  "Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.",
  "yeah, scoop up indoor all day when you are not busy is very damaging to you mental health",
  "Psychologies studies show that spacing out your studying and relearning helps you remember more information, you could try to section off your studying and then reviewing information before the exam!",
  "I think it's different for everybody and you'll have to find out for yourself what you would want going forward. Stay strong, it sounds like you're a great parent!",
  "you can share you problem with me freely",
  "Sorry to hear that. How long have you been in a slump?",
  "I know how hard it can be to live and feel alone. Do you have any pets?",
  "What do you like to do to keep busy?",
  "Using tools to build houses helps to release endorphins, which can release anxiety.",
  "Tomorrow you can try to think of how to go on with things :). Contact some legal aid people to help you get your dog back for one.",
  "You also.",
  "Definitely hard. You'll have to try to find something for you to relax. Even if it's just walking or reading.",
  "I am sorry to hear about your heart condition, that obvious compounds your problems. I believe that things are going to improve in the New Year though",
  "I am not. Are you? I am very appreciative of those front line workers, I often think about how hard it might be to be in their position.",
  "It sounds like writing your feelings down helped you greatly in the past. May I suggest going back to writing and even letting someone you trust read what you have written down to understand how you are feeling?",
  "How are you feeling now?",
  "I am great. Is anything bothering you today?",
  "Hello! I am here",
  "That would be a great idea, especially with the holidays",
  "Let me be straight ok? you somehow don't have any other options but searching",
  "Do you know anyone in the class? Maybe you could try studying with them and see if they can help.",
  "I personally have dealt with depression and i know how isolation all of that can be. Sometimes i find it helps to give yourself time to feel what you need to feel first before trying to feel better.",
  "Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression?",
  "That's really hard, but there are supports out there.",
  "That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now.",
  "Yea, with young kids it is hard to tell sometimes",
  "I'm happy to hear that.",
  "how is your side? Please how may I be of help",
  "you too, it's very nice talking to you",
  "I understand that completely being shy person myself",
  "So your girlfriend broke up with you a week ago and you have no idea how to move forward. Is that correct",
  "Although I am not a specialist, I might be able to cheer you up a little",
  "Hello how are you doing today?",
  "I am so sorry you had a traumatic experience",
  "yes, give them time",
  "Yes here to listen and to help you in anyway I can",
  "Good thing he has you! he's lucky to have someone like you in his corner.",
  "It seems to me from chatting with you that you are extremely anxious about the situation.",
  "Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. You can get comfortable with them before you hangout :)",
  "Is it possible for you to receive a raise from your current job?",
  "maybe if they see it all out there, they will undersstand your position",
  "I hear ya, im doing everything i can to make a bit of extra money just so my kid can have a semi normal christmas!",
  "I can see it being hard not knowing for sure.",
  "What would you define as full commitment from him?",
  "How are doing?",
  "Having many boyfriend is not a big deal",
  "yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen",
  "Apparently, the side effects are usually minimal and temporary if you have them at all. The people that are having severe reactions have had issues with vaccines previously. I would keep an open mind. It might help to ease your anxiety about the future.",
  "That's great to hear. Both COVID and the election have certainly been stressful. What are some ways that you have been able to support each other?",
  "Well I hope I have been able to be of help and it has been nice to talk to you!",
  "Would you like to tell me about it?",
  "I know that nothing I say can take away your pain or make it not have happened, but I care that you have these feelings and I care about you.",
  "Yes, you're growing and trying to do your best and wanting to expand your boundaries and make them clear. You have taken the right approach and are on the best track to having a successful relationship in the future. Great Job! Thank you for sharing your story with me today.",
  "nice talking to you!",
  "People can only love and respect you when you treat yourself that way",
  "You are very welcome.",
  "hello there, how are you",
  "Those are both great ideas! Yoga in the park sounds awesome. Yoga is another great stress reliever and form of exercise that is often free or very inexpensive.",
  "What are some things you like to do?",
  "I felt much the same way back when I was in college. My parents paid my way through school, and even got me to pursue a major that I had no interest in.",
  "Are you in school and working at the same time? What have you found recently to make extra money?",
  "warm is nice. i used to live in florida",
  "I love music",
  "I get it- bummer",
  "try to watch comedy movies that make you happy as well",
  "Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction :)",
  "is your fiancé in reovery himself?",
  "That is an excellent way to help relieve some stress from our daily lives.",
  "Do you think getting in contact with a job agency in your area would be beneficial to you?",
  "It's nice to display them in pretty frames. YOu could even frame a few and give htem to your niece. She may appreciate them more if they are displayed in a nice way.",
  "I am Bob, your Christmas Night therapist and helper.",
  "Did you try to message him to see if he can chat with you? so that you get a chance to understand what made him break up with you?",
  "I wonder what it would be like for him if you hung up the phone even after he said he still wanted to talk.",
  "I suppose it depends how you frame the issue to them. If you say, \"So-and-so is bothering me and I can't stand it\" then you are complaining.",
  "Sometimes, finding joy can be difficult. Especially when what we always turned to for joy is gone.",
  "Why did he leave you?",
  "It sounds optimistic but it is the truth, when I step out to perform, I'm always nervous. BEING nervous looking for a job, that is NORMAL. To expect to feel like you are super confident is unrealistic. Most people are nervous, but they do it anyway.",
  "That's a good place to start and hearing feedback can sometimes be hard to hear but I think you can do it!!",
  "Asking for help isn't always a bad thing. I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out. I was so relieved.",
  "Your welcome have a good day",
  "I definitely can understand that, but it is important to think about your future happiness and security too!",
  "I'm okay. What is making you feel tired?",
  "OK. This is a temporary feeling and it will pass. Please be kind to yourself.",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. Studying for tests can be very stressful. Do you study by yourself or with someone?",
  "I know that you must feel that this could be a problem but I think you will be able to just ignore her. I am afraid I must leave for my next appointment now.",
  "Gosh, life hasn't treated the pair of you very well, has it?",
  "Now it is time for more steps.",
  "You'd need to get legal aid. Try and find a solicitor who works pro bono.",
  "Thank you and best wishes!",
  "I see. Sleep problems are very common you certainly aren't alone in this. With some changes I am confidant you can improve your sleep.",
  "bye",
  "Let's face it, there does come a time when it seems that not much can get worse",
  "You're very welcome, I hope you have a great holiday and feel better knowing you have options.",
  "Take a cup of coffee, sit and write your thoughts then burn them",
  "Have you tried exercise? Research shows it can help with depression. Depression can be caused by atrophy of certain brain regions... Getting the blood flowing can help.",
  "My husband's work was at a standstill until summer. It is better but shows signs of slowing down too.",
  "I understand. Video calls can feel a bit less personal sometimes. Do you live alone?",
  "I have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and I understand the added stress that can cause in your household.",
  "You are always welcome",
  "don't worry, it's okay i am used to it",
  "we all face different pressure and have to find ways around it",

  "Yes, a lot of times! You are not alone in this.",
  "I'd love to go to a hockey game. I've never been to one. Thanks for your email!",
  "I can feel that you have a lot of pent up frustration with this, especially after trying so hard.",
  "I know that you have done your best, but keep on trying more ways by telling someone",
  "That sounds hard",
  "Maybe it can be a good opportunity for her to change her lifestyle and get off the drugs",
  "It's hard to be optimistic when everything seems so uncertain. I can't imagine how lonely that would feel especially in a new place.",
  "Yes it has!",
  "Do you think any of these ideas might help?",
  "I understand that being honest is important. I always feel the need to share with my husband. Do you think this information will do more harm than good if shared?",
  "yes do that and stay positive",
  "What are these thoughts? :)",
  "I like to run every morning, and it seems to help make alot of stress evaporate.",
  "Thank you for your service. I can understand how that might be a difficult situation for you, especially with your experiences. How are you handling this situation?",
  "That is awesome! Sometimes it is really hard to take time for yourself.",
  "Does your friend work",
  "Ain't that the truth.",
  "B&J's and a few good rom-coms ought to put you in a better mood! Lol",
  "Everybody is facing a challenge time right now, we are all together on this",
  "no problem. Have a nice holiday to and remain safe.",
  "That is very true. It is only temporary, you will be reunited with your family soon. But also, you have their support, it just might look a little different at this time.",
  "How do you think you will get through this? Do you have someone to talk with?",
  "It sounds like you're holding onto a lot of guilt about this incident.",
  "how was your day",
  "I can understand. Have you ever consider starting a journal. A place to write your deepest secrets?",
  "Communication is key in a marriage",
  "So you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you.",
  "That's hard to feel like they are treating you like a number when you are working so hard. Have you talked to them about it?",
  "I know that I've had good luck battling my depression by just finding ways to not be at home. Hiking, going for walks, going for drives...",
  "He could say that. And if he is lying, do you think he will begin to be honest? You will have to judge for yourself. If he is lying, he will continue to lie. And you will feel it inside of yourself. Is this the first time you felt this way? Or has this happened before?",
  "What do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her?",
  "I think you sound very capable, despite the amount of stress you're under",
  "Those can be really hard feelings to deal with, but reaching out and acknowledging them is a very positive step. Is their anything in particular making you feel anxious?",
  "ok good. I see online that Tennessee Dept of Veterans lists some mental health resources",
  "It sounds like you are really stressed over the future possibilities. It also seems like you love you job now so it may be hard to leave.",
  "(I can't end it from my end, you have to :))",
  "I think you should work extremely hard during the shift so the boss thinks you have changed your ways, at the end of the shift",
  "There are websites like Decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil.",
  "i hope everything turns out for the best",
  "Okay I hope I was able to help, good luck!",
  "Was the other person someone you knew",
  "Yeah, that might be of use and it will help you see other people in your shoes",
  "Glad to hear :)",
  "that's great to hear. it sounds like if you address the issue that has made you depressed in the first place this will go a long way to making you feel better about things.",
  "True. I don't think you are alone. Is there something that you can do to make working at home better for you? More frequent breaks? Better work space?",
  "So you still want to be friends but she doesn't.",
  "have you two ever considered seeing a marriage counselor?",
  "Luckily I have never been in that situation but my friends have",
  "Without treatment she may just be getting worse.",
  "Well you're resourceful at staying warm, at least. You mentioned wanting a companion, are you living alone?",
  "I’m understand how hard ending a relationship can be.",
  "People suck.",
  "I've been in a similar situation. I was with someone who was controlling in a lot of aspects so i can feel your pain and struggle. I can feel your anger too, and I imagine that it is alot. It is not your fault, and you aren't allowing this to happen to you. It is out of your control. Don't ever blame yourself.",
  "Keep your body and mind clear before you go to sleep has proven to allow for a better sleep.",
  "Yes of course! I hope you have a good day! :)",
  "what are they trying to shame you with?",
  "i find getting out for walks is helpful. i live downtown in a small city. i wear a mask while I walk and veer onto the grass, into the bike lane or whatnot if someone comes...or I look ahead and cross the street if it's convenient...that makes me feel safer when i walk. i have a medical condition too.",
  "That said, I am still not totally sure where I am going a quarter of a century in so I am perhaps not the best person to take advice from :D",
  "Oh No! I can understand why you would be sad.",
  "Yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. Perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions.",
  "Hello! I am here to help, could you please tell me what the issue is?",
  "How may I help you today?",
  "Good night!",
  "It is rough for our children to see adult stuff like this. They might not be able to understand. I would suggest trying to set down and talk to them about it, when you are ready.",
  "What is bothering you today that I may be able to help with.",
  "I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn't think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking.",
  "I'm an older woman, almost 60. I've been married 20 years but I had a lot of boyfriends and I can tell you one thing, If they start to look elsewhere, run for the hills, they will continue to excuse their behavior, apologize, say they will change, and it just gets worse. I drove myself insane with worry, suspicion. I wanted someone to treasure me, not cheat and lie. Cheaters don't change their spots.",
  "Bye, have a wonderful day.",
  "Hello, I just connected. What do you want to talk about most?",
  "You're certainly welcome. Take care of yourself!",
  "We are all working towards making ourselves better and I know that you will be successful.",
  "I'm doing great, thank you!",
  "Unfortunately there are people out there who are not true friends and who just want something to talk about. I have experienced that myself.",
  "You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?",
  "I understand people can be cruel and selfish, but not everyone is. Some people want to help! Life is definitely worth living for.",
  "glad to hear so!",
  "Do you have any other worries at this time or want to explore this any further?",
  "In your case, you can control how many applications you fill out. And it sounds like you are filling out many. I believe if you keep doing that, you will find a job.",
  "of course! i got into puzzles...and games with my little one helped pass the time",
  "I think you need to decide whether you just just let it go or whether you cant' and won't be able to continue the friendship",
  "What is it about work that gets you going?",
  "You are very welcome! I am glad you chatted with me today.",
  "Goodnight and good luck.",
  "Have you spoken to a professional? Is this something that you are able to do through your insurance or work?",
  "Have you been feeling this way for a while or is it a surprise change?",
  "I'm sure you'll do your best and pass that exam with flying colors!",
  "it sounds to me like you are willing to do what it takes to be sucsessfull",
  "If he makes that threat again, you might wish to inform him that \"revenge porn\" is a crime these days. If he knows that you might to go to the authorities, that might get him to leave you alone.",
  "I can see that you are feeling upset and angry when he talks so much and that is totally understandable.",
  "it all comes down to you have to let him see that you can stand on your own. He's treating you like this because he thinks he can control you",
  "I am doing well. Thanks for asking. It is really nice outside today.",
  "So from what I understand, you are struggling with study strategies to help you pass your tests?",
  "I totally understand why you are sad. It's very hurtful when someone talks bad about you.",
  "i am good too",
  "I know many people have started adopting animals due to the lockdowns. I don't know if a pet would make you more or less crazy",
  "Besides the basic hand washing and hygiene, I don't think we can prepare anymore for it. I think at this point, we will either get it or not until they figure if the vaccine will work or not.",
  "Hi, how are you today?",
  "We were supposed to chat for at least 10 messages each i think",
  "Well if you can get some concrete info such as from the CDC and John Hopkins showing case counts in your area. Show them graphs so they can visually see the impact. Also if you can get a hold of their doctor yourself, see if you can convince them to give your parents a call, say to check on them and give them some advice.",
  "It was my pleasure.",
  "There should be a website for the local gov't in your city. Also: there are NGOs that help people in abusive relationships. They can provide counseling and more.",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. How can I help?",
  "This is a large cross to bear. So what do you think your next steps are going to be?",
  "You are very welcome! If you ever need anything else, feel free to chat again!",
  "I've also struggled with the same thing. My parents put that pressure on me so I understand that.",
  "I think you should try to talk to them to get to know what is going on. Have open communication.",
  "I really like indeed.com as well as glassdoor. They give good suggestions and make it easy to apply",
  "I can assume you had been together for awhile",
  "my ex told me I am a partygirl because I drink too much, so I stopped. Trying to get him like me more. Since then I have not been drinking.",
  "That's a great idea, everyone loves feeding birds! Glad we were able to chat.",
  "What kind of hobbies do you have? Or are you involved in sports or any type of other activities that you enjoy?",
  "Maybe you can do some research on areas and places to move during the holidays. Look forward to when you can sit on the beach.",
  "I think that that was bad advice to be honest. I think that you are being ripped off. Do not worry, there are things that you can do about it!",
  "hi there, how can i help you this evening?",
  "I found a lot of chat boards and information from a google search. You are not alone and it is OK to feel and to be going through this.",
  "What type of movie were you trying to watch? Maybe choose a happier movie than a sad one.",
  "There are companies hiring.",
  "Yeah, it took me quite a long time to break it off, and I'm glad I did. I'm glad you decided to call it off with your ex too, it's not an easy decision",
  "You are not alone, a lot of people experience anxiety attacks due to physical stimuli.",
  "That must be very difficult not having your parents to support you and your loved one.",
  "In the past when I have dealt with depression following a breakup I have taken up a new hobby. I found I liked crochet. I made a blanket that I still have today.",
  "It sounds like you're scared of the virus is that right?",
  "No problem! Glad I was able to help! Is there anything else?",
  "Okay. Are you excited for the upcoming holidays?",
  "Thank you for sharing your feelings with me today.",
  "So he wanted you and made you feel special",
  "I'm glad it was helpful. I wish you luck!",
  "Is there anyone in your imediate household you can confide in with your feelings?",
  "Me either, I had never seen a resume with a picture. Yes wear a nice suit and look good.",
  "I its been quite tough for us all with the Covid 19 chaos",
  "I am well!",
  "I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly",
  "Knowing the severity of the mistake, i think you should tell as good things come to people who are honest :)",
  "Not everyone has to go through that, so try to be understanding of yourself.",
  "I understand why that would be so. I have had a similar situation happen to me before.",
  "There are many organizations that can help you get out of an abusive relationship.",
  "If i were you i would call your friend maybe she has some suggestions of things you could do based off of your skills.",
  "watch the brene brown video on youtube with the cartoon animal about empathy - it should help when looking for friends to rely upon",
  "I really understand how you feel. Honestly the best thing I did was cool off a little and think how I want to take this friendship forward.",
  "Work can often pay for trainings or offer suggestions what may improve work strategies.",
  "Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn't blame yourself.",
  "How may I help you today?",
  "So just a week and she is settling in",
  "I think learning a trade would also be a great idea! I would definitely reach out to see where you can start that process.",
  "that sounds great. I find that your mindset is very important, you can only finish great if you feel at ease. Why don't you just wait and study on your own first, and officially start when you feel reassured?",
  "That could be fun and validating for you! It's always nice to get some attention",
  "I haven't experienced addictions but I have been supporting my daughter with her addiction for many years, and I have seen how challenging it's been for her.",
  "So you lost your job that is why you are sad right?",
  "You could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year. Do you have a resume?",
  "I'm good.",
  "i lost my job also because of covid economy inpact",
  "Do you feel as though Covid is making your situation worse than it would otherwise be?",
  "Exactly. Let his problems remain his. You worry about you and your daughter and he can watch from a distance confused at his failed attempt to reflect his own dissatisfaction with life onto you didn't work. I think you will feel freed of any stress this has caused.",
  "It sounds like you care more about what others think of you than how you feel about yourself.",
  "are you able to identify any change whatsoever? I ask since any imbalance our body and mind experience is sometimes enough to see a poor reaction, that may lead to things such as migraines",
  "how may I help you today?",
  "I used to have a hard time forming a meaningful relationship but then I realized it's because I had nothing in common with the people I was trying to form them with. Once I discovered something I was really drawn to I met people that way like volunteering in my community. Have you tried finding people you have more in common with.",
  "It sounds like he is dedicated to his job, which can be a good thing, but I do understand that you want to be put first sometimes as well.",
  "It's understandable for you to feel doubtful. I would give them another chance, suggesting a virtual happy hour and see what they say now hat they no longer have covid excuse",
  "Have you spoken to her about how you feel?",
  "You're welcome!",
  "Yes we are. Would you like to tell me about it?",
  "One thing that worked well for me was speaking to members of the board.",
  "Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.",
  "You're welcome! If you need any more help just chat back with us again.",
  "We can be our own worst critics, and that's never been truer than when we're facing a challenge. Self-doubt can be such a pain, but when I find I'm having trouble believing in myself and working toward my goals, I'll focus on what I already accomplished, and that helps give me that extra push to keep going",
  "I know how you feel, I have often felt anxiety before a job interview.",
  "Oof, I see. I can understand you being upset by that, it's a silly reason to disapprove. Was the blowout in any way productive or just angry?",
  "If you have a plan already it will ease some of that anxiety that will come from this tough situation",
  "You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord?",
  "i have big shoulders! whats on your mind?",
  "Not a problem at all!",
  "But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?",
  "Yes its good to not dwell on the past like that. Have a good day :)",
  "Ok, be well.",
  "Ah I have done some teaching, it's a very worthy profession.",
  "I see, can you explain what session you skip?",
  "Anything else I could help you with?",
  "Could I ask if you are currently participating in any activities or diets to manage your weight?",
  "Ok thank you I hope things get going in the right direction for you.",
  "I am baking cookies for others, so don't feel sad. Maybe I can cheer you up with chocolate chip cookies.",
  "ok i understand now. What was you and this other woman talking about?",
  "Seems like she is domineering. Tries to disrupt the class environment",
  "yay! a haircut!!! Congrats",
  "That can be hard when friends don't reach out despite all your efforts. Have you discussed this concern with them?",
  "Take care!",
  "Are you a veteran? I am happy to help. I am sorry to hear that.",
  "When did this start?",
  "What kind of hobbies do you have?",
  "I don't know if we are supposed to give out private information.",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to tell me more?",
  "you're most welcome and enjoy the rest of your day!",
  "Which do you and your man like to communicate?",
  "I feel the same way. I cant wait for life to be normal again. It has been a hard year.",
  "Let me ask if you are involved with a church",
  "She and her husband ran the business, but I continued to be burdened with extra responsibility, no extra money or benefits. Eventually, the gas station down the hill from us was hiring at a hiring hourly rate than I was receiving from them. I ended up leaving and going back to school.",
  "When you go to bed at night, if you can drift off to dream with a clear conscience, then you're doing significantly better than her!",
  "Its a good thing you moved then because at least now you are away from him",
  "I can tell this is challenging for you. May I suggest talking with your professor maybe you could pre record your speech and play it instead of actually doing it? Or maybe practicing with some friends or collegues and seeing if they would help you not be so nervous",
  "I'm enjoying hearing the rain on the roof! Can I encourage you in some way?",
  "Can you tell me some examples about the injustice?",
  "Hopefully, you all get to spend so much time togehter.",
  "You're welcome! I am glad that I could help.",
  "Of course. Do you still experience feelings of sadness when thinking of that time in your life?",
  "Not necessarily studying less but break the 6 finals into smaller tasks. Use index cards to organize yourself. I alwyas start with an outline of topics i need to cover then put them onto index cards.",
  "Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now.",
  "I found it very useful!",
  "You should give them a call. Just out of the blue, nothing commuting. Just a casual chat and see if they want to do something. If finding something to do doesn't work out during the call, at least you contacted them and maybe will feel a bit better because you talked to them.",
  "Wow, it must be beautiful there! I'm in Pennsylvania.",
  "Sure no problem. Hopefully things will be much better for you soon.",
  "They most likely will, so it is better not to use that chance",
  "I am very sorry to hear that. Facing pay cuts at work can be a very stressful situation.",
  "hello",
  "Hello there, I am really sorry to hear that. Can you give me any more details?",
  "Just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines. Extra questions from students are wildcards and you can only handle them within the scope of the assignment.",
  "are you planning to get a vaccine and if so do you know how long you have to wait?",
  "hi how are you",
  "If you are interested in religion often times they have local support groups to join as well.",
  "Sounds like your support is not appreciated.",
  "What has you worried? I know right now... its a hard time for so many people. I have struggled with my own anxiety the past few weeks.",
  "Yes, I agree. Sometimes it just takes time to process all the emotions.",
  "Ping :)",
  "Im from new york",
  "Hello, how are you today?",
  "you can never know people until something happens",
  "yeah... heh I don't go there, being half English and half Irish :). But yeah that was so my era..",
  "When I need to escape intrusive thoughts and rehashing things, I'll put on a podcast. Or documentary, or something that's calm, straightforward and factual.",
  "Everything going good",
  "I too live in a rural area understand the complexities of tying to find someone. So my next question where looking to find that special connection.",
  "You really should - nobody has the right to dismiss you due to your health problems, that is totally outrageous.",
  "don't think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most.",
  "try to give him more time",
  "I see., yes that could be a risk for sure.have you spoken to your manager to see if there may be other opportunities in the manufacturing facility for you? I bet they would rather retrain you for a different position than lose you.",
  "yes i think it will work",
  "Does he have any close male friends?",
  "It sounds like your mood has been a challenge for you to complete school.",
  "can you tell me what happened so that i can understand?",
  "I find that sometimes some breathing exercises, getting fresh air, can help clear your head.",
  "Yes, I would reach out to old friends who may be willing to give you insight into how they viewed things. Support groups can feel intimidating but are usually very welcoming and truly there to help people.",
  "Thank you. Anything else I could help you with?",
  "It's going to be very painful for a while because you have been invested 3 years in this relationship. Do you have friends to talk to that can encourage and support you?",
  "Have you contacted your bank yet to see whats going on?",
  "Hmm, well maybe take some more lessons, We can always strive to be better at everything we do.",
  "I'm sorry to hear that, what about the holidays has you down?",
  "it's really a terrible time. you are definitely not alone in feeling that way. Is there something specific going on?",
  "I sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control over how you are able to interact with people. I wish you the best in dealing with this and hope you begin to feel better about it soon, especially entering into a new year!",
  "That's concerning, but very understandable. Are you able to financially seek additional help? Sometimes it's just what you need, as hard or embarrassing as that may seem. No one needs to know what you seek, but it is important not to disregard additional help, be it mental health, physical therapy, or just general prevention and detection from a PCP.",
  "No need to upset as it part of life. Call your best friend and discuss your feeling and I am sure you will feel good.",
  "I see. If it is really likely to happen, I would brush up my resume, make it stand out, but job search can be really stressful.",
  "You are definitely a hard worker and I hope you know that. You make a great employee puttin in som many hours.",
  "Yes :)",
  "We all have busy hectic lives at time. True friends make time to be with one another. This world is full of beautiful people to bond with. Keeping a closed circle of friends is a blessing.",
  "Hopefully, having a new friend who also enjoys sleeping will assist you with this particular disrbance.",
  "have you tried to do some exercise that works dealing with depression",
  "If you need to chat again I would be glad to talk to you, I think you will do great at fixing your rut. Thank you.",
  "Can you tell me what happened?",
  "nice! it's really fun. I have a few 'gigs' I work on but that is my favorite. And thank you about my son. I don't miss school - he's already ready to graduate!",
  "It's very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time, or a daily routine.",
  "That sounds like a definite winner :) I see a Turner prize beckoning in your future",
  "Hi",
  "At least he is trying, as i said before, even with it being so common, it is a mystery to most.",
  "you too always :-)",
  "Ah yes I know how that feels. Has anyone ever taught you any relaxation techniques?",
  "i found a moms group on facebook. They were great to answer pregnancy questions and offer support and suggestions.",
  "hello there",
  "I am not sure what sort of medications they are - are they specifically for insomnia?",
  "Well sounds like to me he doesn't know how karma works. lol.. The universe makes ways for us to have what we ask for. A closed door is really re-routing you to where you are suppose to be.",
  "Please know that you are not alone in this situation.",
  "Okay that is perfectly okay. You are fine. If you need me to assist you in any way just send a question mark.",
  "The thing about AA is everyone in the room will be understanding and nonjudgemental and supportive. And you can learn from them what has worked for them. And it's okay to sit quietly and just listen, you are not forced to participate actively.",
  "Hello how are you?",
  "Don't be afraid! Remember a teacher's job is to teach and help you, she may look a little mean but it doesn't hurt to try and ask, she can't fail you for being confused :)",
  "That's the spirit!",
  "Hello, Merry Christmas Eve",
  "if that does not help try to seek help from a marriage counselor i have heard they have saved many marriages from failing",
  "Sometimes people just move on from one another. I personally wouldn't try to make these friends see what you are doing. I think you should focus on you, and look to the future.",
  "Nice! Well, two kids is A LOT, especially since they aren't in school yet. You are dealing with the care and growth of the most complex organism on this planet...times two! That's incredible. First of all, give yourself a pat on the back for that. Secondly, is it ok if i ask if you felt guilty for having fun without them? Often times guilt robs us of the ability to take care of ourselves, which happens to me all the time.",
  "I used to be a night owl, going to bed early in the morning. I reset my schedule very gradually. I went to bed 15 minutes earlier, and set an alarm for 8 hours later. I did that for 3 days, then I would ratchet it back another 15 minutes. It was a gradual process and the only way I could fix it.",
  "Do you have to wait until you get vaccinated to start working on getting a girlfriend?",
  "your welcome have a good night.",
  "That's really hard. but,i think you can do it.",
  "Awww, thanks. How are things going in your world today?",
  "Ok great have a great day",
  "Bye!",
  "And yet here we are :P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.",
  "And it is important to remember that everyone goes through cycles of feast or famine, and that when you are walking through a famine you yourself are not a failure. As long as you know you are doing your best to succeed under the circumstances you have been handed, you will never truly be a failure to yourself or to others.",
  "I know what it is like to be depressed. I also take medication for this. For solutions, studies show that working out and exercising can help depression. Have you considered this?",
  "That you have to ask him, tell him to have an honest thought, no judgement, be completely honest with each other",
  "Wow that sounds like a big problem. Is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?",
  "Is it possible that you are overqualified for those positions?",
  "Perhaps you should implore the help of somebody else in his life. I understand wanting to help your friend, especially when it's negatively impacting your own mental health, but there's only so much one person can do. You both deserve to be in a good head space and asking for help is okay.",
  "what about family I'm sure they'd love to have you around for Christmas",
  "you're welcome!",
  "I actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet. Not the best situation but hey, my family can eat.",
  "Have you looked into government assistance due to covid complications?",
  "I am okay. What would you like to talk to me about?",
  "Do you think a break would help you feel better able to deal with the demands of her friendship?",
  "please do and remember that they are only there to help you, as I am sure they love you very much.",
  "Gardening and Horticulture is a great hobby! That definitely could cross over into some of her science classes to make things more interesting and relevant to her.",
  "I can certainly understand the struggle with being at that stage in life. Has this affected you negatively?",
  "Okay, in the mean time follow my advice. It will help.",
  "Usually when I find myself going off the deep end, I can reign it back by realizing that the power lies in me. My control to use a relaxer like a cocktail hour, to just be that. It does not have to be a contest. It should make you feel good, then leave it. But if you cannot control it, try and de-stress another way like baths or massages",
  "Don't forget to breathe. Exams are stressful but I would suggest don't cram everything to the last minute. Usually the hour before the exam, I do something else.",
  "That sounds like a difficult situation. How long has this been going on?",
  "try to talk to him first. before you take them out try to talk to your husband alone, without the presence of your kids. Try to see things eye to eye. If he start to yell of curse, you must try to stay calm. Be the strong one in the discussion. If things dont work out tell him that you wish to take your kids out for a break.",
  "Hell, How can I help?",
  "You have been a good person to take my advices.",
  "Of course! I had a good time chatting with you! Thank you as well :)",
  "what made you feel this way?",
  "Oh no, why do you think she is abusing them?",
  "Ok that is one step closer to justice. When is that going to take place, and did you find out if that can be expedited?",
  "I really hope that I have been able to reassure you a little bit and help you to try to think things through. I wish you a very happy holiday season!",
  "well that is good!",
  "I hear you. Is there a particular reason why you might feel this way?",
  "hi how are you today? How can I assist you?",
  "youre welcome good luck and I ll say a pray for you",
  "A stimulus check! Yes, we can all use money during these trying times.",
  "It isn't anyone's business what you do on your off hours.",
  "There are a lot of good people out there just looking for friends. You sound like a caring person, I bet you'll find new friends.",
  "Good Evening",
  "christmas is right around the corner though, and it is almost the 15th. military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush!",
  "I too had to relearn a proper balance between my personal and professional life.",
  "When I was in school, we started study groups. They were so helpful and encouraging to each other. Are there any study groups available?",
  "I'm sorry to hear that, it must have been hard for you",
  "Awesome! Have a wonderful holiday season :)",
  "Is she aware that you are a special ed teacher and not a normal teacher",
  "I am so sorry!",
  "That's great. You'll hopefully get at least 2 more normal years to enjoy school. I hope that is reassuring.",
  "I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people",
  "Research has shown that fear of failure does stem from feelings of anxiety, but is it possible to look at fear of failure from a different perspective?",
  "Good also, what would you like to discuss?",
  "Like I said, I used to be sad too and not optimistic. But now I am optimistic because I know what it is like to be sad, and I don't want others to feel how I have felt in the past.",
  "Thank you and same to you.",
  "It definitely is. I guess thats what makes us human though.",
  "You too",
  "It is great that you can identify what needs to be done in this situation. It sounds like you are ready and willing to seek out help for yourself! Do you have access to the resources that are in your area?",
  "Accept that you are anxious so you can control it instead of it control you. Accepting actually makes you less focused on it, because you don't have to wonder about it.",
  "I am sorry to hear that, I used to have sleeping issues as well. What do you do in the hour leading up to bed time and what do you do in bed before you sleep?",
  "Yep, for sure. It's not going to be easy.",
  "I run",
  "Very good. I am glad that you have a good family who can support you whenever you need a help.",
  "Hello",
  "You will. It will just take some reflection on your part.",
  "Why do you think you will lose your job?",
  "This is a hard time of year for many people.",
  "Hello, how are you today.",
  "Do you have enough money to keep going?",
  "It's great to try to integrate it into your day. All of us tend to have at least a few moments each day to ourselves. Even if it's during a shower or bathroom break, you really can meditate anywhere! It's all about being in the here and now.",
  "Not a problem, thank you for sharing!",
  "I really hope you'll take the leap to trying rock climbing! It was so fun for me when I did it and I can't wait to get back out there to learn more (hopefully COVID will be over soon!) :-)",
  "if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know.",
  "Well, you could read a few books about relationships? Do some research",
  "You are more than welcome. I hope you feel a little reassured now.",
  "I am female",
  "Okay well have a good day!",
  "You are very welcome! I hope you have a great rest of your day and please don't hesitate to message if you want to chat again!",
  "do you know brene brown and her work",
  "Oh really? Why is that?",
  "I personally like to write out my feelings in a journal and sometimes i listen to music that makes me feel happy. Do you have things that you enjoy that you have tried to do?",
  "Is there an impending deadline for the project you're worried about meeting? Maybe you could contact them through email or another form of outreach.",
  "nobody likes to see that one's friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back",
  "I understand that you are feeling like your professors don't see you as a person with feelings. What happened to make you feel this way?",
  "That was along time. 6 years. WAs the breakup sudden or had it gradually happened over time",
  "how long have you been feeling this way?",
  "Yeah I understand what you're going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?",
  "did you go your separate ways on good terms?",
  "So you feel that he is misunderstanding life? That he feels that he deserves things just for existing?",
  "Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern",
  "I do think, and I am not sure how old you are, but infidelity is unfortunately not super rare. I have experienced it myself. I used some resources on even places like Reddit (Surviving Infidelity) to help me process what I had experienced and to also learn from others.",

  "I understand. There are always companies or jobs out there that are scams. What I found worked best was looking at reputable sites like LinkedIn, GlassDoor, etc. Right now is a good time to find a work from home job from reputable companies.

  "Ah im sorry to hear that. Best advice i can give is to play for exactly that.",
  "Did you speak to your friend about it?",
  "I smoke too much too. It costs a lot and it's really bad for my health. I think I am gonna try and quit - again, sigh - in January too",
  "You are welcome. That is really kind of you to want to protect your children from harm. It seems like you feel the best way to do this is through owning guns? Have you thought of any alternatives, since the votes have been cast?",
  "I am sorry to hear that. On another note, have you considered speakign to your GP? Perhaps medication might help.",
  "What kinds of things are troubling to you?",

  "Have you tried reaching out to him throughout the course of these past two weeks to see if he would respond?",
  "i went through a similar experience during my schooling, and i had to explain to my parents that i don't want to disappoint them but i still have to do what makes me happy. having a career that you hate doesn't feel good - i've been there",
  "I can definitely understand why that would e so stressful for you. It hurts when your hard work goes unrecognized.",
  "you are welcome",
  "i'm so sorry. when did you find out?",
  "clarify, what you think",
  "I think exercise bands are a great way to keep your limbs loose and nimble. They are affordable and available on Amazon. I have some and I think they're great. YouTube can help with exercises.",

  "Thank you for talking with me.",
  "I don't think I could have done as well as you in that situation.",
  "If you didn't do any of those things ever, how would you feel about yourself?",
  "100% agreed - In person is always way better than remote",
  "I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family.",
  "Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives.",
  "Oh Do you want me to suggest some ideas of overcoming sadness in my life..",
  "What is the worst part of it for you? Can you identify that? I'll be honest, my husband and I don't even see anyone dying.",
  "I can tell how anxious and upset that is making you feel.",
  "Oh! I'm so sorry! Haha!",
  "I see. Are you likely to be able to meet them in person soon, given the global situation?",
  "Those are completely normal feelings to have, but I know you can get through this!",
  "(you need to quit first and take the survey.. I can't :))",
  "Hi, I am doing well thank you, how are you doing?",
  "Is it legal for them to give you such short notice? You might have grounds for a complaint.",
  "Doing good and yourself?",
  "Would you be able to tell me what is causing you to feel stressed?",
  "Since you are a software developer, isn't there a possibility for you to work from home? Many companies are offering their employees being able to work remotely",
  "I'm an introvert / homebody so it's been fairly easy for me. I have a lot of projects at home that I enjoy doing (reading, puzzles, meditating, yoga, etc) that keep me busy. I was also, very lucky to be able to keep my full-time job so that keeps me fairly busy most days. But I like a change of scenery and do Mturk tasks for fun",
  "I take it that the loss was sudden and it was a shock to your system. So how have you been managing the sadness and grief since it happened?",
  "I know you are working hard, but do try to switch up your life so you get some exercise and take care of your health, and perhaps list some people to call who you haven't checked in with in a while to switch up your life, bring some pizzazz.",
  "To be clear, you're feeling bad about not being able to keep up in class and that's making you feel even worse about it?",
  "Well, I think you should give her some space but people do sometimes get back together after they've separated",
  "Often times career centers can help you to find job opportunities or perhaps online college could be an option if you want to further your education.",
  "Have you ever threatened to leave him?",
  "it sounds like you're really anxious and stressed about this situation let's try to figure out a path to move foward",
  "Maybe schedule in a call with her for the future? I have been making time to speak with my family every Tuesday, it gives us something to look forward to each week",
  "Hi! Hope you are doing well",
  "Neither was my ex husband. I know what your going through just take some time for yourself while they are with their dad.",
  "That's great, the computer skills will help out a lot. And the programs help with writing skills too.",
  "Sometimes it is necessary to take a temporary job that you don't really like just to make ends meet alas.",
  "Are your friends drinking with you? Do they know you are trying to drink less?",
  "I'm sorry to hear that you are feeling angry today. Tell me more about that.",
  "Just stick to the plan. Spend more time together. Cook dinner for her. Make a strong bond and my best wishes are there for you.",
  "Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after.",
  "You can also take this time to focus on hobbies and other things that you wnat.",
  "That's an unfortunate part of most group projects, I hate to say. Interpersonal communication can be so hard. I have been a project manager in the past, and found that you have to consider Person XYZ did not wake up in the morning and decide to make your life harder.",
  "I don't have any experience in this area but I am sure that an online search would be easy.",
  "That's absolutely great, make good use of them (^_^)",

  "Your child is so fortunate to have you. Keep fighting to win custody, I believe in you.",
  "Hello, how are you today?",
  "Do you like the new path you've chosen for yourself?",
  "I completely get that. I am thinking that most people are feeling isolated therefore communication with others are feeling even more challenging thank usual. Playing games can certainly help. What type of games do you play? Perhaps there are people that share the same interests",
  "I am really sorry to hear that - it is a terrible time to be out of work isn't it? Unfortunately it is happening to a lot of people",
  "Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co-worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective.",
  "I can sympathise with you having siblings with extreme mental health problems - I have been there too and I know how difficult it is.",
  "And you too, goodnight.",
  "After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it.",
  "if i get you clearly, you mean your friend disappointed you. how?",
  "I wish you all the best!",
  "Why are you feeling sad?",
  "Yep, still here. Are you still seeing my messages?",
  "I know that I don't know her but to be honest it does sound to me like your friendship is a bit toxic.",
  "Hello, how are you doing today?",
  "Just never give up. Two years will go by quickly if you keep attending.",
  "Are there any hobbies that you have been interested in but never had the time for? Or perhaps hobbies that you used to do but have not tried in awhile?",
  "You are most welcome. Is there anything else you would like to talk to me about?",
  "Sure, my pleasure!",
  "Revenge is a dish best served to the trash! There's no relief in bitterness. Might as well let it go, move on an move up from there!",
  "That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them?",
  "Yes, trust matters.",
  "What about valerian root or other herbs?",
  "That's good to hear. Can I encourage you in some way?",
  "Hey I am a dad and grandpa. That is what grandpas do",
  "That's some months that you've been out of work. What kind of work are you looking for?",
  "you're welcome, goodbye!",
  "It is not your fault. It's actually your ex's problem. There is nothing to feel ashamed of",
  "I can tell you're stressed about it and group projects are very hard. Perhaps you can all put a plan together an allocate tasks to make sure that everyone puts in their share of the work? Is that something you've considered?",
  "If you gave her a large amount of money and have any kind of messages about it I would look into trying to get it back.",
  "Well I love to read. Do you have anything that you could do to help you relax and take your mind off things?",
  "Have you tried to express your feelings in one way or another? If you don't want to talk to others, there is always other ways - such as writing, music, etc. Have you tried any different ways?",
  "Please take care and stay safe. Are you nervous?",
  "That sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard.",
  "I'm OK as well.",
  "Good evening. How can I help you",
  "The main thing is, do you enjoy your studies and consider them worthwhile?",
  "Sounds like you need a little help staying on track and feeling me productive?",
  "How long were you and your partner together?",
  "is there any possibility of him getting a vaccine? he seems to be testing positive fairly often",
  "Have you been able to talk to friends about it?",
  "oh! did you search for new job?",
  "Or maybe there is a way online you could do that, virtual meetings, since you find it hard to get out. Could you handle a zoom group meeting?",
  "You should try setting up a fun day for them where they can get to know each other.",
  "That's a good question. I would show support for her and empathize with her and her situation. Do you have lunch with her? Can you send her a text letting her know she's valued? She might appreciate that.",
  "People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.",
  "Absolutely not! Individual frustrations are the best things to focus on before everything that happens in the world.",
  "Is there anything I can do for you today?",
  "Those use dogs are super smart as well. I think that's a great choice.",
  "How may I help you",
  "I am sorry to hear that. I have insomnia and I know how horrible it is. Have you seen your doctor?",
  "Well, you did say it made you stronger. It takes courage to move past it.",
  "That's awful! You need better friends than that!! What about your family?",
  "Okay it has been nice chatting with you, feel free to end the chat now, goodbye.",
  "I'm doing alright, thank you. I'm here for you if you'd like to tell me about anything going on in your life.",
  "you as well :)",
  "Have you spoken to anyone at the college about this?",
  "I would suggest just keep trying to talk to her and apologize and tell her you been really busy and was not trying to ignore her",
  "Oh wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating. Do you speak to your brother?",
  "i think it may be beneficial to give your friends some time, before attempting to speak with them again. maybe you can spend time with your family while you are waiting for them to cool down.",
  "i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what is bothering you?",
  "That's terrible. So you had an argument and he hasn't spoken to you in two weeks. Is that correct?",
  "I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while.",
  "From what you're saying, it sounds like you think you have no power. Is that true? Are you really powerless in this situation? Do not underestimate your power over your life.",
  "It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don't know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship.",
  "I'm jealous. hehe I often wonder what our friends to the north are going through. I'm glad to see you reaching out too. That's awesome!",
  "Of course. Anything worthwhile takes time.",
  "Some other ways are staying as involed with anything I can, like reading, writing, or drawing.",
  "What other hobbies do you have?",
  "Yeah! It will all be worth it. Maybe try to understand it from where he is coming from, did anything happen for him to feel this way?",
  "I know a lot of people who are feeling this way. It is a difficult time",
  "I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What are you seeking support for today?",
  "Do you think it would help to give me an example of a time when you lose interest?",
  "That sounds really hard! Does that mean things tend to escalate quickly in your home?",
  "I understand how you feel. I had a bad break up, but it turned out to be a good thing in the long run.",
  "Thank you so much!",
  "That's true and divorce can be expensive. You mentioned before that you feel like you are with him mostly because you are lonely, is that how your relationship started?",
  "Okay and thank you.",
  "I am well, how are you/",
  "So you are feeling as though you are letting your family down?",
  "you want an empathetic friend. nobody has gone through the exact same thing you have but the emotions are common ones. you will be ok, even if you dont feel that way now",
  "That sounds like so much fun!",
  "That sounds frustrating, especially if you're one of the employees affected and when the new boss doesn't seem to know what he/she is doing with the reorganization.",
  "do you have other friends",
  "How is your day going today? Do you have anything on your mind?",
  "Have you reviewed all of your materials?",
  "OH i meant i think we have had enough, But ill keep going cause im in the same boat as you on that front.",
  "What help you need? please can you explain",
  "Yes, your family, friends, and health are all really important! I hope you stay safe!",
  "Ah I see.. you feel as though you friend is dragging up things from the past which are no longer relevant to your friendship?",
  "Oh, I definitely feel frustrated with myself when I was to start a project and don't have the energy or motivation to go through with it. This has happened on many home projects or craft project. Or even with losing weight and make healthy decisions.",
  "So if I understand the anxiety of you losing your job is increased because you also have to give your wife the news?",
  "You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that Doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship.",
  "That's true.",
  "If you can't breath normally, then I think it is best to start to meditate in order to control your breathing and make you less stressed",
  "I mean you are 29 give me a break. You are very mature and know what makes you happy and you have had some time to explore the world so to speak. Give me one moment to think of a solution",
  "Alcohol is a way of self medicating; some people find it helpful to talk to a doctor to get an actual prescription for a medication to help. I personally stopped drinking once my doctor found the correct medication for me. That allowed me to be happy without drinking.",
  "You made the right decision to join and discuss your feelings. Do you like the Christmas Holidays?",
  "I hope that I have been able to b of some comfort to you",
  "What is causing you to feel frustrated?",
  "I'm here",
  "I understand that. I hope I was able to be of some help, at least.",
  "Applications are so weird! Why do I want to work here? Um, because these bills won't pay themselves lol",
  "I suggest a book called \"Bounderies\" one of the authors is Townsend -- great book.",
  "That sounds very positive! What would you like to study? Will you work your way through?",
  "Yes, meditation is very good at calming down the mind. Does it help you? If it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently",
  "Also, if that works, then build from there. Remain calm and little by little talk about your concerns.",
  "Are you eligible for unemployment benefits?",
  "Have a good night!",
  "you need to press quit now :) I can't do it this end",
  "When I miss someone, I tried to call that person or do video call and spend time virtually. It makes me feel like that person is not far from me. I really feel connected. You should do that often.",
  "I totally understand. I have had to provide financial assistance in the past. A technique that worked for me was reviewing and tweaking my expenditures for a short period of time.",
  "Getting a lot of rest or releasing stress will improve your fear and anxiety, which will lead to a more positive attitude to finding a job. Having a more postiive attuide well help you find a job.",
  "It takes courage to tell how you are feeling.",
  "yes, you are right especially during this pandemic many people face these kind of difficulties",
  "Are you still with me?",
  "I understand, I think that you should tell her about your situation and how you feel.",
  "have a great night!",
  "Good how are you doing?",
  "You have a calling on your life. Don't let the dream die",
  "That would be a healthy activity to enjoy together, and it should help burn some of their energy too.",
  "drive on down and over",
  "What is making you feel this way",
  "I will, thanks",
  "God loves you.",
  "You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair",
  "Just make sure it doesn't happen again because you need to learn from this mistake :)",
  "how are doing you today, what is troubling you?",
  "don't worry, everything will be good at the end.",
  "I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you.",
  "My pleasure dear friend",
  "that must be horrible. You were already engaged?",
  "I would share my feeling with someone that I felt closed or some family members or your spouse that you can share your feeling.",
  "I see that COVID-19 really changes the way we do things. Is it possible to do a zoom study group or Facetime with friends?",
  "And you :) remember to hit the quit button and take the survey ;)",
  "If you want to",
  "I am glad to hear that you have someone supportive in your life. What is your current line of work?",
  "Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help!",
  "That is understandable. Is there any option she can move in with you so you offer help.",
  "It's good you are asking yourself questions. What do you want out of the relationships?",
  "Perhaps you shopuld now focus on taking care of yourself. Did you neglect anything you need or enjoy to take care of her? Could you do that now?",
  "Has any of this been helpful? Is there more I can do for you?",
  "I know that it's really difficult right now, but it seems that the virus is going to get better in the new year. We need to push through these next few months and then it will be over.",
  "Okay. One thing--",
  "LOL well it's good that you are able to look on the bright side about this. Have you considered making plans for the future, once the pandemic is over?",
  "I am sorry to hear that. So, I gather that you and your loved ones are really not getting along right now?",
  "Yes, I have. I often look at work assignments as larger than they are and can only get started when I break them down.",
  "It sounds like your daughter does not understand your feelings.",
  "bye",
  "This is very troubling for me to hear! I used to be a cutter as well so I can relate to this 100%",
  "You too!",
  "How can I assist you?",
  "That is a great idea! You are working hard and that hard work is going to pay off! Just try to relax and be patient, which can help with your stress.",
  "Only you know whether or not if you can look to forgiving and moving forward or if this is such a fundamental break that it is not something you can mend.",
  "oh wow 15 years? I really believe you need a raise and doing more work now.",
  "What led to the breakup?",
  "don't think too much, make yourself busy with other things",
  "You do as welL!! i hope you feel better soon!!!!",
  "Tension can be high when you already feel stressed about the job situation.",
  "Ok. That sounds like something that you should talk to someone about. How many classes are you taking at the moment?",
  "no problem glad that i could uplift someone it lifts me up to help others",
  "I understand better now sorry for the confusion",
  "No, I do not have the premium package",
  "Have you tried reading? I find reading motivates me sometimes, too. Sometimes too much thinking alone leaves me digging a hole for myself.",
  "If that is all that I can do for you today kindly end and finish. Bye, for now and have a great day.",
  "oh okay, have you discussed anything with your friends to see if you find any alternative way of meeting?",
  "I understand that many people now in these days are in a position where he or she needs to be at a location and that is stressfull",
  "I know, it would be nice of her to ask how are you? But maybe she thinks you are a very strong person that does not need help since you do not voice it.?",
  "I understand that completely. It's very helpful to speak with people face to face. However, have you sought other ways, such as through Zoom, to interact with peers having the same difficulties?",
  "I can feel your anxiety, and I completely understand why you're feeling that way, but you don't know for sure that will be true. Have you started looking for a new job already?",
  "Oh that's a shame. Have you tried, for instance, getting some exercise an hour or two before bed?",
  "Yeah, a way to make the best of it.",
  "Well I am happy to listen to any problems that you have",
  "Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join.",
  "Why do you feel you can't tell them?",
  "Okay, well, firstly I think it's a good idea to try to stay calm and not let yourself be overwhelmed. Is it possible to get any sort of tuition to prepare for the exam?",
  "Yes, can you try organizing a virtual get together?",
  "this might sound silly, but reddit is a great resource. there are some great support groups there who help each other and lift people up",
  "Are they normally understanding of things like this? Do you have a good boss?",
  "Hello. I totally understand being stressed out by school. I am currently in a Ph.D. program and it can be overwhelming. Do you have any hobbies to help with your stress?",
  "Just from this short conversation, I can tell how upset you are. It's definitely hard this year since people aren't traveling.",
  "don't worry about it just lighting the mood but really girls can be complicated and i get that its hard to understand why she left",
  "It sounds like you are frustrated. Do you mind sharing what the fight was about?",
  "it can be stressful but a positive stress. remember you are researching how to help yourself and feel better!",
  "why do you think this would be an issue?",
  "Hi Larry. What sort of job do you do?",
  "Well, I believe that there are some new advances in migraine treatment at the moment so I think things will improve for you. I am sorry if I am not being more help.",
  "trust is tricky. do you know brene brown? the researcher, author, TED talk researcher?",
  "That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year",
  "Sounds good. I am glad that you trust me. What did the strange machine do?",
  "Is there anything else that I can help you with today?",
  "That's great to hear! My suggestion is to always think positively. You can do this!",
  "I understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something.",
  "Is it for work or for school?",
  "It just worries me that he might treat you the same way if you were ever in the same position",
  "have you tried reaching out a company hotline or maybe an hr department in your company to speak about this issue anonymously this could help with the tension between you and your boss",
  "Taking a social media and news break could be a good idea. Sometimes it gets to feeling like we have to keep reading about the horrors of the world or else we are not doing anything at all.",
  "just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you",
  "or laughter programs",
  "Try to take comfort in the fact that she was your go to, She was there for you but she was also trying to make you a better person.",
  "vitamin d d is over the counter! any pharmacy, amazon, its easy to find and cheap",
  "you're welcome, have a lovely day",
  "Yes it is. They help you learn to trust again if that's what you want. Would you like the web address?",
  "have fun :)",
  "I can relate to that. Maybe you can start with journaling and writing out your feelings and thoughts. They may help clear your mind especially in the evenings.",
  "That is difficult. I understand how it feels to be lonely. Something I’ve done when I’ve felt that way was to learn to fall in love with myself. I like to do self care and make time for things I might not have time for if I were in a relationship.",
  "Do you have any hobbies? I found that refocusing my energy into something I love doing really helped to bring my mood up.",
  "I can understand that.",
  "Have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue?",
  "I bet you are handsome! Don't let it get to you.",
  "/sounds like you are depressed? Well I can assure you that I am here if you need or want to talk about why your depressed.",
  "Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended. And, it can help preserve your sense of being grounded.",
  "I'm sure you are busy, but realize, your emotional health is important too and we always need to make time to connect with people.",
  "You can terminate the convo at any time!",
  "That makes sense. How long were you guys together?",
  "What's on your mind?",
  "make a fresh start again",
  "That's a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines. The biggest thing is to not use your bedroom for anything but sleeping; so don't read a book or play on your phone in bed, you have to train your body that when you go to bed it is time to sleep.",
  "It will take time, the best way to let it not control you is by talking about it. You gain control over it that way.",
  "I am really sorry. Is she able to get any other sort of work, even if it's less well paid?",
  "Hello Doing good",
  "Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something?",
  "what was it about your situation that was so bad? did you lose your job? why are you so stressed? lack of financs. depresseions because of lack of job finances etc... lover?",
  "Sometimes you don't like the activities they do? Have you thought of any ways you might be able to get them to do activities you do like?",
  "You should be understanding, especially since you already know this.",
  "Whichever you enjoy.. pick one. There are a lots of online resources you cloud use.",
  "yes! although i probably couldnt walk nor run 5 miles a day. i love getting out to enjoy nature. it always helps to keep mind off things. does that usually work for you?",
  "have you try looking another job from nearby",
  "It's good for you to do that. You'll feel better with time.",
  "Yes maybe that will work for them and probably want to be outside",
  "That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?",
  "It is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. I am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration.",
  "OK, I understand.",
  "A group is an excellent idea!",
  "Bye, have a great day",
  "How is life treating you otherwise?",
  "Pets are great like that. Do you perhaps have a neighbour whose dog you could walk if you can't get one of your own?",
  "I think starting with the school counselor is a great idea, I feel she will have more of an idea of how your son functions in school and maybe give ideas to helping his mood.",
  "That is not good. Is this a new thing or has it always been this way?",
  "You can always share and contact me if you need any help. I will be happy to help. Take care.",
  "I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed.",
  "It sounds to me like you're thinking that you've disappointed your parents by falling behind in class a little?",
  "was it a common thing that he didn't give you the attention you wanted?",
  "Thank you for sharing with me, and I truly hope that it has helped you even just a little.",
  "Do you feel that this has knocked your self confidence and affected your family life at all?",
  "Not having a job can feel overwhelming, especially on top of this pandemic.",
  "It sounds like you feel your friends are too busy for you.",
  "I have not but I know people who are in your situation.",
  "I see and there was a time I felt lost or not needed too. What is it you would like to do with your life?",
  "why you are lost a job?",
  "Maybe you can develop your own courses? Or, you can also become an online trainer for a variety of organizations. Since many companies are transitioning to a work from home environment, this is a great time to offer your training services to various companies.",
  "Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track.",
  "I have had a friend not to trust me and i know how hurtful that can feel, maybe there has just been some sort of misunderstanding.",
  "It seems like you really do have a lot on your plate. Do you have any other family members who can help with your duties? Older children, a spouse or parents nearby?",
  "Do you workout?",
  "Yeah? Can you tell me a bit about these known unknowns?",
  "OK MERRY Christmas",
  "Good evening.",
  "Glad to hear that :)",

  "I'm doing good!",
  "Yes, pulling through this is the most important, because there may be a better future waiting ahead of you",
  "You as well",
  "It sounds like the stress of the unknown is really getting to you. I have definitely felt this way over the past year too, You aren't alone. When I start to fell stressed, I take a few deep breaths and focus on what I can control.",
  "if you want to maintain relationships, then you woudl have further converstations, but if you are ready to move on, nothing they can say will change what you need to do - move on",
  "if you try to get into a new relationship with the mentality that woment cant be trusted.... what re the chances you open up and let the next girl get to know you?",
  "Time management can be very difficult with a normal class load, that sounds exhausting.",
  "If you need permission, I hereby grant you permission to pursue what is meaningful to you.",
  "Have a great night and take care of yourself. It has been a pleasure.",
  "Oh wow that would make things complicated! But yes the deep breathing would definitely help, I'm sure!",
  "I can relate. This whole year has been a mess.",
  "good thank you",
  "Well... to be honest it doesn't sound very terrible. Most children that age do things like that ;)",
  "unfortunately, most places of employment take advantage of their good workers cause they feel they can get away with it and they will leave. But, at the end of the day, your well being is important.",
  "You should also explore any and all financial aid offers they can give you. More than once I have been told that not as many people apply for scholarships and grants as you think.",
  "You haven't done anything wrong. I have felt that way at work before too. I went to therapy to deal with my difficult work situation.",
  "Well, they most likely do it over zoom. But it's better because it's one on one",
  "Maybe next year will be a better year",
  "you don't think others",
  "I can imagine that's difficult, that would be a lot of close time together.",
  "I can definitely understand that. I remember feeling a certain way when I pursued another degree. What would make you feel a bit more confident about the idea of school?",
  "Do you need any more advice on this matter or do you have any other concerns? The bully is the problem, not you. Do you have anyone who can stand up to them with you for support?",
  "Does your class have a study group?",
  "Is there anything else you would like to talk about?",
  "I'm really sorry to hear that.",
  "Hmm, it sounds like she isn't being completely honest with you.",
  "That was a big shock, I was in relationship for 3 years",
  "Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about?",
  "not really. what i do is record the video beforehand, and then upload it.",
  "OK sounds good",
  "That's great to hear, I'm glad we were able to chat!",
  "It was nice chatting with you as well. Take care and stay safe",
  "The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry",
  "It sounds like that you are doing great with your hobby. Have you try to interact with anyone else, such as an art community or your friends on your feedback?",
  "You can support your family by working at the library and reading up on higher paying jobs while there.",
  "Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them?",

  "That is really relatable. I can understand how scary it is for you, especially with your husband's pay cut.",
  "It sounds like you are unsure of how to deal with favoritism in the workplace. I have dealt with similar situations.",
  "We all need help from time to time. I feel privileged to be able to listen to what you are going through and know you will be successful.",
  "I understand that budgets can be tight. Maybe someone part-time?",
  "Can you tell me a little more about your situation so I can better understand?",
  "Uh, oh, how do you think she will react?",
  "Sorry boys fighting roblox. LOl. I don't think you are supposed to say that in chat.. FYI. Nor are we probably allowed to talk about mturk.",
  "Can you press quit and take the survey :)",
  "Kool beans! I love life/outoors just in that same way.",
  "Ok so it seems like you are quite angry at the moment at the thought of her with someone else, is that true?",
  "just hang in there and remember everything happens for a reason, even though we may not know the reason and we don't like that it happened!",
  "Hey, how are you today? Anything on your mind?",
  "im here",
  "How so? What is the specific difficulty? Is it with your resume?",
  "My son have same issue. We have to deal with this covid situation.",

  "Could someone come to your home perhaps? You could set up your own cameras there. And you could make sure to get someone with excellent references",

  "Have you found ways to be physically active?",
  "Oh I know that feeling it can be rough I have felt that way lately.",

  "Hi! How are you today?",
  "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.",
  "I think that either way you choose to proceed there is always the choice of remaining amicable. You're all adults, so sitting down and discussing what comes next is an inevitability. Maybe they will choose to leave, or you'll decide it would be better for you to go, but at least the discussion would be ongoing to perhaps resume the friendship at a later time?",
  "Yes, It will be hard at first because you are not use to it, but once you get started your life will be so much more relaxing. Your stress level will become more less than what is was before. Also, You will be able to have a clearer mind to concentrate on your schoolwork more by having this new schedule.",
  "Merry Christmas to you to!",
  "You seem like you are open to trying new solutions and putting in the effort to up your competitive level. Stay positive and take care of yourself mentally and physically, and I think you will be successful.",
  "I have sometimes felt this way too. Do you have a pet? I have two cats and they do help to cheer me up when I feel especially bad",
  "I can understand very how your mom is going through hard time.",
  "Okay try not to worry. Can you tell me a bit about why you feel so bad?",
  "I'm glad to hear that! Thank you!",

  "Well, that is good, Just start focusing on yourself, my friend.",
  "You can always reach out to me and I can providing you a place to vent and express yourself and the feelings that you are having. Hopefully you feel like a plan to begin apply for new jobs is a start forward.",
  "Sometimes, something as small as an accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. Especially when listed and checked off to see the progress.",
  "That's understandable, especially with how the past year has been. Everyone is on edge and everything feels so uncertain, but that's okay, because you're not alone =)",

  "Let's hope that next year will bring better times for all of us.",
  "Have you tried talking to him about his drinking? Is he otherwise a pretty good friend when he's sober?",
  "Oh yes. Me personally, I like to scour youtube and find an environment with a sound I enjoy such as the beach. When I listen to that sound, I try to put myself by closing my eyes while sitting on the floor and breathing deeply for some time. It may be worth a try for you. I hope it helps you. Good luck!",

  "Did the two things start at around the same time, do you remember?",
  "you seem like you have a good head on your shoulders!",
  "So, it sounds like you already have a plan to turn things around. How far away from 18 are you, if I can ask?",
  "I recommend searching online about meditation, also one of thing that helped the most for me was exercise and eating healthy.",
  "I am so happy to hear that. I hope you have a great day every day!",
  "You could also reduce fear by considering Door dash and other food delivery services.",
  "Have you tried to talk to your husband about your feelings and how you might not be willing to accept this?",
  "that's insane! I did Chem and Bio ONE semester at the same time - with 8 hours of labs a week - I quickly changed majors. I respect what you're doing!",
  "That is a really worthwhile goal and I genuinely think that you can achieve it if you stick to your guns. Please try not to let one bad year put you off perusing your dream",
  "I honestly don't know. Cover letters are weird, I never know how to do them correctly lol I don't know if they're there just to make sure you're following directions or if they're actually important. I like to think someone does, but I'm really not sure.",

  "Hi, sorry I just saw this",
  "I am sorry to hear that. What are you feeling helpless about?",
  "have you started looking for another job?",
  "Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren't hurting for money.",

  "Hello!",
  "I've been feeling blessed today",

  "You too! byee",

  "I am sorry to hear that. I will help if I can - what is the matter?",
  "At least they might give extensions.",
  "Yes, that's good, ask them if you did something that offended them and why they excluded you. If they deny, then you can tell them how you feel. If they care about your friendship they will do something to fix",
  "Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say?",
  "No problem! I hope your situation gets better!",
  "Yes the pandemic is making everyone feel a bit raw I think. Are you actually seeing your family in person regularly?",

  "One thing that comes to mind about your marriage is how I continued to work on myself, and surprisingly, some of the changes I made in myself helped my husband change. For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time. So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain.",
  "Agreed. Taking the breather definitely helps.",

  "If you still love him, what is the reason for the break up?",
  "Something like a spa day. Get a beauty treatment. Pamper yourself then you will have an attitude that will help you move on.",
  "I don't think it's really anti social, it's just a result of a chemical imbalance I think. But it's a nuisance.",
  "Just from chatting with you I can tell you are very disappointed and upset about this.",
  "Hello. How are you today?",

  "Ah i understand. I am sorry about that.",
  "It is much more difficult for me to remain focused and positive when I lose sleep. I have had to focus on self care, finding a friend to talk about my problems with, not someone who will TELL me what to do, but support me. So you need a good support system. And I find things like prayer, Bible reading, nice soft sheets to sleep on and some herbal tea like Sleepy Time help me relax before bedtime.",
  "Hi there. How are you doing?",
  "Well, at least you're putting it to good use.",
  "Hve you tried talking with your friend?",
  "I see what you mean. Finding work in this environment can be stressful as well. In any case, I can say that a good way to start is to account for all transactions you make.",
  "Have you considered going over her head and putting in a complaint? Especially if she is making everyone else miserable as well. Someone more senior might be able to do something.",

  "My daughter has a sponsor, it's an important part of AA (and optional). Her sponsor has been clean for over 20 years. She is there to support my daughter, and help her work her way through learning the 12 steps. Beacuse she's been through it, her sponsor is very understanding and supportive.",
  "From what I can tell, your girlfriend cheated on you and then broke up with you because she thinks you are not the right fit for her. Is that correct?",
  "There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you?",
  "We're planning on camping in the desert. That's a good idea to save money. How do you plan on saving money?",
  "Iam glad to help you provide with emotional support..",
  "I enjoy writing and speaking my mind",

  "Hi there! How can I help you today?",
  "Would you feel happy if you think about after Covid, maybe next year?",
  "(I really did lose a cat earlier this year btw :( )",
  "I understand. But I want you to think about this. Your mental health is more important right now because it is affecting you. And how you feel really affects those around you, especially the ones who love you. If you take some time to think about what is more important to you in life right now can help you make a decision.",
  "Yes, I know! It's supposed to snow this week where I am. So, I understand you are in need of someone to talk to. What's going on.",

  "Do you feel that perhaps holding onto this relationship is doing harm to you?",
  "Got any good ideas?",
  "That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.",
  "You mentioned that other friends were also concerned about them, have you tried talking to them about setting up a video call with a group. This might appeal to your friend and they may see this as a fun activity to get involved in.",
  "Do you have other friends there for you to help you through this tough time?",
  "I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities.",
  "I am assuming that you and your friend are very close and have been friends for a long time. Did you try talking to her over the phone? having a honest conversation with her and letting her know how you feel may help at times.",
  "Tell me about the situation that you are facing",
  "You are welcome. You are on your way.",
  "Thank you so much. I am genuinely happy to help. It was nice to meet you as well.",
  "Something I used to do when I was struggling with anxiety over this was come home and play video games, which is something I really enjoy doing. Have you tried to really dive into more activities that you enjoy?",
  "Can you give an example and then maybe we can replay it a different way?",
  "I think you got a lot of things to be excited about and look forward to - 1. warmer weather 2. longer-daylight hours 3. vaccine upcoming - which then will open up the activities you enjoy like shopping and going out for coffee 4. Getting a puppy In the mean time, I think it helps to try to keep busy. Is there goals you can set for yourself each day? Like maybe working on a room for a puppy, to take a walk outside each day, an area of the house that should get cleaned, or start a new hobby (like finding a book you have been meaning to read)",
  "Hi there, how is your day going?",
  "Why did you stop playing insturments?",
  "Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I know being alone in the holidays can be rough.",

  "They can be, but many local governments and municipalities have therapists that work on a sliding scale if the financial aspect of therapy is a concern.",
  "I understand. I went though a lot of feelings myself when I divorced. Blaming myself, blaming him, missing him. It took some time to work through but thankfully today it is all a distant memory. Sometimes time is the best healer. Be kind to yourself and take time for you.",
  "I am so sorry to hear that. Have you tried anything to address the situation? Perhaps bringing it up to him subtlly? Or even just asking how HE is, to see if he has siomething he wants to talk about.",
  "Have you thought about if you can trust him after that?",
  "You should not feel bad. Have you not donated to food banks yourself when times were better? I used a food bank in a crisis time and now I give back whenever I go shopping",
  "Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school?",
  "I always try to see the positive side of every situation, they always happen for a good reason",
  "I can understand that, kind of makes you feel mistrustful?",
  "I understand.",
  "How are you?",
  "Lots of obsessive, intrusive thoughts?",

  "Oh? What's happening?",
  "I actually am getting a second degree in religious studies",
  "So what I hear you saying is that you are engaged and your fiance will not speak to you. However, you are unsure as to why she is behaving this way? Is that correct?",
  "I can understand how you feel being such competitive environment. However, the most important is your well being. I think as long as you do your utmost best, there is no need to stress over rankings",

  "I had someone that felt very insecure because of me talk badly about me to our mutual friends and even family. What I ended up doing was to completely block the person out of my life and go on living and being me. I showed the people that that person was a jealous, insecure liar simply by being myself.",
  "I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes. Because if we say yes because we CAN'T say no, then we feel resentful. So If I can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense. Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first.",
  "it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?",
  "There is a lockdown, but it isn't as strict as some other states.",

  "We do not need to face a risk of driving through the snow....",
  "So What's bother you a lot? What happened which leads you to feel like this?",

  "Okay. Have a good night!",
  "How long has this been going on?",
  "so, you envy your friend having a good spouse, is that correct?",
  "I see! I love your career goal. When I was a student, I visited my professor's room a lot. I did that for almost all classes. Some professors helped me a lot and gave me a lot of hint. Do you visit them as well?",
  "It is a tricky situation, to be sure. Have you talked to anyone else about it?",

  "It seems like a little thing, but I find that taking Vitamin D supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed.",
  "No problem, I hope you feel better soon!",
  "It can be hard to make new friends in a new school. I'm sure the stress of being new isn't helping with the studying.",
  "Do you feel like you're ready to tackle the tasks needed to prepare yourself for approaching the board Wednesday?",
  "You could start a conversation by saying that you just want to check on him and see if he is okay and how he is doing. You don't want to start the conversation by immediately telling him to get help, as he might just get defensive.",
  "What types of things was she texting him about?",

  "I can understand that. If I may can I ask you if you live with anyone?",
  "If you are healthy/feel comfortable with going out, you could consider volunteering at an animal shelter. You'd get to interact with some folks, some animals, and add something to the resume. I don't know if you are likely to get hours back at work or what you do, but that could be fun!",
  "Yes I do but the task really is finished. Please press quit, I can't do it my end. Neither of us will get paid if you do not. Ten turns each and fifteen minutes.. we've done that.",
  "During a time like this, some people find it helpful to keep busy doing some kind of activity to take their mind off of their pain. Is there something you can do to take your mind off of it until you're ready to manage your feelings?",
  "best of luck, and please take care of yourself",
  "what sort of things are you trying to decide?",
  "OK so do you have any other experience or all food industry?",
  "bye good to talk with you",
  "I believe that you can succeed for sure.",
  "Is this affecting you really bad?",
  "Yes about 2 years ago I started to have sleep issues. I noticed the phone was the first thing I picked up after waking up, and the last thing I put down. It is terrible what technology and social media does to us.",
  "I was feeling REALLY lonely last month, and then I started a gratitude list and that helped, then I called some people and began to make new friends. It really helped a lot.",
  "Well, I think you need to find a hobby that will help you and that will enable you to make new friends.",
  "I would say maybe try some meditation or something to calm and center yourself. If you feel ready earlier than Wednesday then follow your intuition. You've got this!",
  "Okay, maybe you should ask your friends, let them know how you feel and see what they say about it",

  "Gotcha. That's rough for you. Sounds like you made a sacrifice to make that happen.",
  "I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school.",
  "I understand being angry about that. Going to school supposedly is/was a way to take control of one's life, it's no longer the guarantee is once was.",
  "So it is your therapist, or psychiatrist that put you on this medication? Do you feel they listen to you?",
  "Is your room dark? Light blocking curtains can help.",
  "Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse.",
  "You are not originally from the USA?",
  "No problem. I hope you find some better ideas. You are not alone and remember you have one of the hardest jobs out there!",
  "Are they okay with it when you decline?",
  "try to catch up with your studies give more time then you feel better",
  "take care!",

  "Do you know what might have happened to cause your and your best friend to not talk anymore?",
  "Have you tried talking to her since?",
  "My sister-in-law really benefits from having her sons in sports. She is able to connect with the other team moms and considers them some of her best friends. Depending on your YMCA your son may be able to participate in some of their programs?",

  "I am sorry to hear that. I am doing fine and hope I can cheer you up.",
  "I see. It sounds like being in the group project is especially stressing you out. Would you say that's pretty true?",
  "It sounds like its been really tough for you and wish you had more support from your friends and even your child's father.",
  "Opening themselves up to the opportunity to be hurt again.....",
  "You can use this to your advantage, and make more conscious choices to better your life",
  "thanks",
  "I am happy to know you will try this. I know you can do it!",

  "When did this start?",
  "I am sorry. What is going on?",
  "My goodness. I know that's very difficult to handle. Are you feeling anxiety?",
  "I used to struggle a lot with depression, but not much anymore. I learned a lot of coping strategies. I can share a few of those with you if you want.",
  "Try not to lose hope. It's hard out there, particularly with what the pandemic has done to the economy. But from what I've read today, more stimulus from the government is on the way, so that should help some.",
  "I was angry for a period of time after my husband passed away and I get where you are coming from",
  "I understand having it seem like there is no one to talk to. I am here and there are others. I believe you can find an outlet to share.",
  "When things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. One thing I've learned to be helpful when I'm stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three. The counting tends to distract my mind from whatever stressful thing I was thinking of before.",
  "I have been there, I major in Biotechnology engineering. Image what life will be like once you are finished with this nightmare assignment. Give it your all.

  "There are some excellent counselling services available if you are interested in going that route.",
  "I'm sorry to hear your sad. Is there anything I can do to help you?",
  "My advice is to try to talk to your family and explain to them that you lost your job and are feeling down. While they may not accept it at first it is a good start to try to give them some context for why you are drinking.",
  "I think we all have one of those friends I know I had one who no matter what happened she had something better happen or something worse.",
  "What else besides unhappy do you feel about this breakup? Often there are a mix of emotions and looking at all of them is important to see the whole picture. People often report feeling relieved, regretful or other emotions with the feeling of unhappy.",

  "I hear you - I found it very difficult to go to counselling too but when I did I found it very helpful.",

  "Anything particular got you down? Hello",
  "I have a group of sister friends and we threw a zoom party. we scheduled it out and we decorated our own spaces and we made a spotify playlist that everyone contributed a song to and basically just had a video party. Do you think your frinds may like to try that with you?",
  "Definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing!",
  "Oh definitely doesn't help but I understand. Working on a computer all day is really hard. I do that too. I try to get myself away from the computer for at least a hour to do something i enjoy",
  "I would encourage you to write out some goals and things you want to change about yourself, ideas for you and your children to do. And fight the blues as hard as you can. I find that if I have a list of things I need to do, I can follow that even when I don't feel like it, and sometimes I get out of the slump.",
  "You're so welcome. I really hope you get back to feeling better soon, Stay safe and have a great rest of your week. Come back if you need any support.",
  "I wouldn't say that Doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty.",
  "I've worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co-workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn't be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth.",
  "It seems like you are missing someone. Hope I get it correct",
  "How are you today",
  "You could definitely call him and express your feelings to him as that would be another great way to get how you're feeling off of your chest.",

  "I am glad it does :D!",
  "(Even if you don't talk to them much, do you think it would be worth reaching out to them?)",
  "I wonder if you could do something like take walks in the park with friends, or see them with masks where you're really socially distanced from everyone",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. It is a tough time right now for people working. Do you want to talk about it more?",
  "I'm sorry to hear you are sad. What's going on? Maybe I can encourage you?",
  "I understand these feelings very well. Sometimes, my fear overshadows my want for help. I find it easier to open up to others through writing rather than face to face. Have you considered putting your feelings in writing and opening up to trusted friends and family in this way?",
  "Then, within that, one task at a time. Segment things he wants to do then reward him with them upon successful completion of school-tasks.",

  "And you too! Goodbye :)",
  "They are a blessing!",
  "I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?",

  "That's good.",
  "Is it too late in the semester to drop the course without penalty?",

  "What do you think sounds weird?",
  "I feel that you can have just as much success as I did.",
  "What is your day like",
  "I understand. I have been in the same situation and I know how frightening it is. Have you though of consulting agencies such as food banks that can help you temporarily?",
  "I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives.",
  "Its actually kind of nice to vent on these anonymous things.",
  "How r u",
  "Gratitude is one of those things, I've found, that is self-perpetuating. Even if you begin by doing it robotically, eventually your mind and heart will want to be more sincerely grateful. I have in the past challenged myself to find five things to be grateful for in the morning and write them down. Whether those things are \"I have hot coffee and electricity\" or \"I won $1000 for free\", they will begin to start a small fire of joy.",
  "Hello there, how can I help you?",
  "How many times have you confronted your boss about it?",
  "Consider directing him to news sources that are not Twitter or Facebook, though I know this is hard to do. it is just a teensy bit funny he thinks that Trump is being muzzled on twitter when they are not deleting any of his tweets.",

  "I am always happy to help. I find it difficult sometimes too.",
  "I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self",
  "Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.",
  "Tell me more about it if you don't mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking?",
  "That's great! Do you know what kind of class would be of interest? I think that you have the tools to be who you want to be. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders and I think you'll be just fine! You may even find a life long passion or friendship! You never know what is around the corner.",
  "Hello! How are you doing today?",
  "Do you think you will be able to do this soon? Lets set a time frame for this goal.",
  "Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.I hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming",
  "Do you feel that they have not been of any help?",
  "I completely understand, I would also feel anxious if I were in this situation. It's an honorable thing that you've taken the initiative and are working hard to support your family.",
  "It sounds like you're on the right track! Keep it up.",
  "Well that is a good start. Maybe you could make a list of things you want to discuss with your counsellor too.",
  "You've come to a good place to start.",

  "You are welcome! Thank you for sharing your life with me!",
  "I know it's heartbreaking, have you reached out to a friend or family member sometimes opening up to someone close is the best way to let every feeling out",
  "Could you suggest she talks about her issues with a specialist?",
  "You need to indulge yourself from time to time :) Get yourself a nice bottle of wine too. Though maybe not chocolate :D",
  "I'm sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.",
  "Exactly! Dogs really do love you no matter what.",
  "I understand that feeling! well hopefully we get paid;) keep your head up:) Good luck to you!",
  "I make a good case right so you might think I was but no, I am not I only wish to be. I wish to be much more than I am but ya know I work with what I can find to do. Id savd the world every day if zi could knowing my efforts were toowrads a good cause.",

  "I'm glad I can help! Is there anything else you would like to talk about>",
  "Is it possible that you are worrying unnecessarily though?",
  "I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.",
  "Oh I see I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you tried doing other activities to make your mind off it?",
  "breakups can be really hard!",
  "this happens very common in friend groups. it is understandable that you feel upset",
  "Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option.",
  "I can tell you from personal experience that loose skin, stretch marks, and loosening of \"other parts\" do all self correct with time. You will feel better about your body again when they do.",
  "I see you are looking for some resources on a course that your professor isn't helping you with. What kind of questions do you have?",
  "Are you starting to feel better about the situation?",
  "I have also been worried recently about finding another job because of the pandemic, but I found that getting back into my hobbies has helped keep me distracted and get my mind off of it.",
  "Does your husband realize that the other child notices it and how it hurts them?",
  "Hi, How are you feeling right now?",
  "Of course! And it wouldn't be fair to her, just as much as it wouldn't be fair to you. Your happiness is just as important!",
  "since Covid time. After Covid than you can go out with friends go see a movie you wanted to see maybe or go get your hair nail done.. What do you like to do just for fun",
  "Then it must be good advice lol",
  "don't ever think you are a bother to anyone. You are loved by those close to you and I am sure they would be great comfort during this.",

  "You've done great at telling me your thoughts and deep feelings.",
  "I know, this year was stressful for everyone in our planet, so you are not alone",
  "I'm sure that you wouldn't annoy them. It's their job to talk to their employees.",
  "I can agree with that! My children seems to always be needing something. It can sometimes feel overwhelming.",
  "You are welcome",
  "And a place to vent.",
  "Yes I think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps. You are welcome! :)",
  "That sounds reasonable to me. And if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. Tell them, I'm sorry, but I feel this is reasonable, and truly it is.",
  "Oh no and how did this make you feel?",
  "Well, perhaps they can at least alleviate your anxiety somewhat. Or maybe even get you a sick note to give you a little extra time to complete your assignment.s",
  "Have you tried talking to your husband about your feelings, and how it is affecting your day today life?",
  "You're welcome!",
  "Yeah, everyone including me, forgets that each individual has their own sets of things going on each day. Always good to look at it through their eyes a bit.",
  "That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming.",
  "Do you want to talk about whats going on right now?",
  "yes! not a whole lot honestly, but i like it.",
  "What are your objections against a private person? Is it that you feel you could not trust them? Do you have any family members who could help?",
  "Is that the kind of job that you can do from home?",
  "I think these situations cause us to take care of our selves first, like you are doing by wearing your mask and still loving your friend (maybe from afar). Your idea of separation is wise, unless you want to protect your relationship with her and let her be.",
  "Do you want to improve for her? or for yourself do you think?",
  "I'm sorry, what type of problems are you having?",
  "I know it's very tough for you, can you stay away from your partner/ people around you for the time being?",
  "I worked for a boss who gave me a chance when I was rather unhirable. I worked there for three years, but I was burning out hardcore. She was kind but she paid me much less than a normal professional would in that position, and took advantage of me.",
  "Have you considered doing meditation to release negative thoughts?",
  "Tell her to meditation or yoga in the morning. This will definitely helped and her mind will be busy",

  "That's very kind of you to say, thank you :-)",
  "If your manager has a supervisor that you feel would not approve of this behavior, I would speak to them. If you don't feel that would be beneficial to you, you could reach out to your company HR department.",
  "i think that most people understand that there are many people in a huge crunch right now. i don't see that it woudl hurt to talk to them and be honest",
  "I wish you all the very best for 2021. I hope that you get to get together with your band again and rock!",
  "is there anything else I can help you with today?",
  "it seems, you are feeling so bad about his situation, and worried of his health",
  "oh! did you try to make friendship with him?",
  "I'm certainly glad your uncle is there to talk to. I know family can be a source of strength. Have you been able to find any assistance from local organizations?",
  "if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak",
  "I know how that feels. It's really hard at first, but it gets easier. There are some benefits to being single after all.",
  "I'm so sorry to hear that. Breakups are never an easy thing. I've also gone through those and they can make you feel awful.",
  "it is bad but recoverable. alot of coughing and alot of sleeping. high fever. but a family member of mine who is 74 caught it. he has diabetes,obese and has heart trouble. he made a full recovery with no issues",

  "I had fear of losing my job at times.",
  "I'm hear to listen to you in case there is something you would like to get off your chest and maybe give some advice or support.",
  "good",
  "That is really unfair and hard to deal with are you close to any famliy?",
  "I feel obligated to help during Christmas because I had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts.",
  "do u have any friends that are still talking to you?",
  "In apartment you house plants are great option. I love walking to. It is a great stress reliever.",
  "I'm sure you will find something very quickly.",
  "ok, that is a bit of relief",
  "you too!",
  "There are substantially more people recovering from covid each day despite the number of infected growing exponentially. I am sure that, with the proper care, your mother in law will make it, and so will your husband.",
  "It sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way",

  "Does your specialist know you are this down?",
  "yeah, covid-19 is a real bummer but i am sure we will soon get over it and the economy will bounce back",

  "Are you considering switching jobs?",
  "Also, there are many online resources that are great at finding available jobs and require your time and effort, but not any money invested. This might be a good tool as well!",
  "I am from upstate New York and it can get nasty when it comes across the lakes",
  "How are your boys feeling about it?",
  "can you talk about your feelings at this time",
  "Yes it is nice. Are you doing anything festive today?",

  "you are very weclome, goodbye",
  "You are very welcome!",
  "Doesn't hurt to check them out.",
  "I looks like you have hard time in sleeping. Correct me if I am wrong.",
  "So, why do you think they think that?",
  "What was happening in your life that made you lose interest?",
  "Ah I hear you on that. Do you feel that this is related to the pandemic or is it something that has been ongoing for a while?",
  "Sorry i was having wifi issues",
  "I think if he is interested still it will, if not his loss.",

  "Church is always a great idea. I think church would be very helpful. Maybe someday you should even consider going to a predominantly black church.",
  "That makes it hard when you have already tried to take the steps to help you improve the situation. If I may offer a suggestion, perhaps you should approach him, and advise him you are not interested in arguing since that won't improve the situation, but be up-front and honest about how this is making you feel, and how his lack of support will ultimately harm the whole family. And also maybe ask him if there is anything going on with him to find out why his support to you, and the children has changed.",
  "So, the question is....how do you deal in the short term?",
  "Okay, thank you for clarifying :-) Your frustration is understandable. Having a job while being in school can be tough, that is true. However if you are discerning you could get a job that would have flexible hours, especially if you let them know beforehand that you're planning on getting back into school as soon as possible.",
  "Well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse. So I would recommend to share time with your love one and clear your mind and take out all the negative things away. Right now Im talking a lot with my brother and me and him never get along. So this is a huge step",
  "I need it and it really does help ease the stress for me",
  "You as well!",
  "that's really hard, have you spoken to any of your coworkers",
  "please can i ask you why she is doing this?",
  "I think you know yourself better than anyone else and are about to leap in to a new chapter of your life. You received lessons from both the past relationships and can take that forward knowing what you wish for and deserve.",
  "I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning. With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat. Are you able to hang out with friends?",
  "That sounds like a challenging situation. How long have you had to deal with this?",
  "this pandemic most definitely has caused frustrations for everyone",
  "Welp, thanks for the conversation, I hope I helped. Cuddle the cat, enjoy the beach, and remember this is all temporary!",
  "Have you talked to someone about this?",
  "What would help you feel better about the situation? What are you doing to pass the time?",
  "Unfortunately this may be upsetting in the short term. I had a friend who had a similar issue. He wanted to end things with his girlfriend and they ended up having an honest conversation, which was upsetting at the time but they are still friends to this day and parted on good terms.",
  "she studies vuneraility and shame. please look for her TED talk and there's a great youtube video on empathy",
  "We thankfully have not got on lockdown just yet, but I know it will be happening soon. We live in a very small town and it has got bad here that either we know someone who has it, or someone in the family has it. It seemed like it just happened over night that it just spread so fast here that everyone is in a panic mode again. What type of things do you do while you are on lockdown?",
  "It can be very hard to watch a loved one destroy their lives. Has anyone every discussed an intervention?",
  "I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.",
  "I have suffered from depression for many years so I can totally empathise with you.",
  "ok clarify your friendship value",
  "That sounds really tough. Sometimes people who are in your situation find it comforting to talk to someone they are close with. What do you think about this?",
  "oh sorry for misunderstanding you",
  "Kinda Ok, but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy",
  "Yeah even i can see that when i see my daughters class. It is a bad situation all around. The thing is though you cant focus on that or it will bleed out into your job. You have to try to stay positive and promote positivity even with how hard it can be.",
  "I think with that kind of connection with your boss especially with your job loss being circumstantial you should have a really good starting point",
  "sounds like you are pretty depressed. that is understandable though",
  "Hi, how can I help you?",
  "Hello there. How are you feeling today?",
  "But of course!",
  "That's an understandable fear.",
  "Goodbye. Have a good night. I hope you feel better.",
  "Some people can't do what you do because they don't have the heart to give someone else bad news. The reality is though, someone needs to fill that role and you do help people",
  "can you tell me more about how you're feeling now?",
  "i can feel how anxious you are about the situation.",
  "I see, that is a problem.",
  "how is your daughter doing now?",
  "Digital contact does have its limitations. Could you meet with people outside at a distance?",
  "Have you tried hanging a large calendar and writing down his schedule as well as any plans you made? Then each morning, do a quick 1-minute check on the calendar to ensure you are BOTH on the same page.",
  "Well, if it is affecting your grades and the rest of your real life then it might be. And it's best to catch these things before they get worse.",
  "Are you wanting to get back to work?",
  "My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can't get stuck in them.",
  "I glad that you were able to talk about how you are feeling. That is a big step in feeling better",
  "that is good, you can have soft copies on your phone, open it anytime your are bored",
  "I agree, there is so much going on that it is hard to stay focused while trying to make sense of all this",
  "How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him?",
  "No you should not have to feel you made a mistake for the time you are taking out of work for a necessity.",
  "It sounds like you are wanting to tell your boss about this. How do you imagine you will go about telling your boss?",
  "Maybe you should do more of that, it sounds like a good idea? Don't feel guilty for doing so either as it acts as a'medicine'. If the'medicine' works then take it",
  "How long have you been in a relationship with your man?",
  "It can be really hard to do, talking to them but I believe in you, you can do it!",
  "Oh! that's very sad but try to move out from this",
  "Sometimes taking baby steps is a good place to start!",
  "i am going for a walk later...I live in Ontario CAnada....it's a bit cool and windy today but I try to get out every day",
  "Can you see any way in which you can work around it and be friends again?",
  "It seems you are a bit low on self-confidence. I have been there too. If I may ask you, does this feeling persist all the time irrespective of the situation or it happens after any particular event - say a test or some outdoor game for example?",
  "Great!! have a great day.",
  "That is a very hard thing to be going through where you very close to your cat?",
  "I would seek the advice of a lawyer. I'm sorry this has happened thats horrible.",
  "That sounds like a great plan. You sound like a very motivated person getting a masters degree is so difficult and you are working toward it. You will do well. I wish you all the best.",
  "Journaling your feelings has also been an effective way to get the emotions out! You seem like you have a lot to share so it might be a good option for you!",
  "Hi how are you doing today?",
  "Are his tempers basically towards you because you are full time",
  "I'm sorry to hear that. What is causing you these feelings?",
  "They are fun to have LOL, now that is the spirit go to the shelter and safe one of those poor souls. And you can pet it and it is happy to see you any time,",
  "That’s wonderful, I am closer to my spouse now also.",
  "If I am understanding you correctly, you feel your mom may not be able to sustain herself during her time of recovery, is that correct?",
  "I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas. My brother and his girlfriend just took a trip out there not too long ago.",
  "Oh, wow! That is really traumatic and I cant imagine that happening to me. You have been through a lot of pain and suffering. I am so sorry.",
  "Take care Nicholas! You as well.",
  "From my experience it has helped tremendously to take a few deep breaths",
  "Oh, I understand being nervous about covid exposure, especially if you're working with the public, who may not abide by mask mandates and social distancing. Is there anything you can do to limit exposure?",
  "I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that's bothering you?",
  "Awesome and Good night",
  "try to read something boring novel it will help you in sleep",
  "I am glad to hear you are feeling a little better! Yes, bad management is so toxic. Even with great coworkers in a job you love, horrible management can ruin it quickly.",
  "Of course! What sort of issue is it?",
  "Oh I see. Apart from isolating how is he doing otherwise, like at school? Is he still seeing his friends at all?",
  "I am nervous in situations that are new to me as well so I understand this. Is there something you can do to get past this nervousness so that you fel comfortable seeking out this help?",
  "What else can I help you with?",
  "Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing!",
  "Doing that definitely helped me too!",
  "just from chatting with you, I can feel how anxious you are.",
  "yes, there is a lag in the system. it takes a while for the response to upload",
  "It sounds like you don't feel like going out?",
  "my friend swears by st johns wort. its some herb that is a natural anti depressant. you could do some research and see!",
  "That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why?",
  "as we were told growing up the worst they could say is no,",
  "It sounds like you are really stressed over the breakup and you want to know how to move forward",
  "well, I don't know if you are being serious or not but I'm going to reach out to Mturk and get them to get help for you. I don't mess around with this stuff.",
  "I am so sorry to hear that. Sounds like your girlfriend and her grandmother could use some time away from her grandfather.",
  "Thanks for sharing with me. Take care now.",
  "And I am glad you are someone easy to talk to! Some of my patients do not argument at all and expect me to end the conversation when I, as a therapist, have to make sure they are good to go! Helping you has been a pleasure!",
  "Sometimes people also grow and change so relationships evolve as well. Is there something you would hope to gain from the friendship that you think could change?",
  "Is this your first holiday alone?",
  "One thing I would suggest is after writing everything down that you rehearse it for a while in front of a mirror and picture that you are talking to your husband while you are doing this.",
  "no problem that is what i am here for",
  "I make a list of the things I can do - And the things I can't. Then you can have goals. And if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. But if there is nothing you CAN do about the situation, you have to pray to God to help you then LET IT GO. If you can NOT fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it.",
  "I too worry about things I feel I cannot control, the lack of sleep due to this just makes it worse so I try to think of positive things, but its hard.",
  "That helps me balance things out in my head sometimes. Sometimes we get stuck. It happens.",
  "I hope our chat has helped you out a bit. Maybe even given you some things to reflect on. You always have the power to change the dynamic of the situation. Remember that.",
  "Or maybe they dont want to see thire kid grow up that fast your are almost 18!",
  "Time is running bad for all of us. We have to take care of our health at this time. Stress can lead to so many disease and it will be hard to afford that extra burden in terms of time and money."
