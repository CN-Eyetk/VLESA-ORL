    "hi i am okay, a little bit sad though",
    "well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do",
    "i have no choice but to go live at home over the break but i am very scared about it",
    "do you feel scared for your own self? or of the situation in general? i'm sorry to hear that. relationships with parents can be very difficult sometimes.",
    "and i have no car to escape it",
    "it's like we live the same life. i also have no car to escape! it seems so small, but it's such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you're not positive in. i feel your pain and i empathize with you completely.",
    "not many to be honest. i have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to",
    "it sounds like covid- 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. it's such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i'm sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don't want to be.",
    "yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along",
    "i don't think you're selfish at all. you have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and i encourage that behavior!",
    "well thank you that does help me to feel better. yes i am happy to bring him home with me and hoping i can have my niece over to intro duce her to him",
    "it is surely my goal! i appreciate your kind words. i would love that if i had a car i could do that but i am not sure how much she will be able to come to my house. i am going to try though!",
    "that is very true i didn't even think of that to be honest! i may use that along the way, thank you for the reminder!",
    "thank you! well i appreciate your help a lot and hope you have a great day!",
    "hai. my name is tom and i really need your help.",
    "i am really sad and stressed up knowing that i am soon losing my job due to the effects of corona virus. for sure if i lose my job now i might go to depression because i have a family to take care of.",
    "are there any ways you know that could help me convince my boss that that it is not the right time to cut down on manpower?",
    "lot of people lose the job in this corona time",
    "i am worried that losing a job may cause me a lot of harm since my bills depend on my current job.",
    "definitely, you have to try to get the other work",
    "don't give up your confident,",
    "sure i do believe myself.",
    "do you happen to know any that can sustain me?",
    "i am not sure",
    "i am an architect",
    "definitely, don't worry..",
    "sure, thanks a lot for your kind words.",
    "god bless you too friend, please keep safe. bye.",
    "hello how are you doing today?",
    "i'm having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. i don't have any.",
    "well it's more that i think i've never had friends. not anyone i can confide in or laugh with",
    "i don't think i'd want to let them know how unhappy i am to be honest",
    "i've never heard of friendship apps to be honest",
    "yeah! they are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with.",
    "i'd really like someone local though, someone who i could meet up with face to face and who knew my town",
    "on most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town!",
    "the problem is that i lack the courage to go out and meet people.",
    "well personally, i have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that i shouldn't blame myself for. you shouldn't blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! and if that is what you are struggling with, then i think the apps would be a really good first step for you! you can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up",
    "oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person?",
    "that's so cool. thanks for your help",
    "hello",
    "good afternoon",
    "i am ok thanks but have an unusual issue. i think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but i'm too scared to do anything about it as i don't want her to leave me. i feel ashamed of myself but i can't help it",
    "yes it is but i should be leaving her and moving on. problem is she is a 9 and i'm a 5 and i love her. pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if i ignore it she may just leave things as they are.",
    "what happened out of interest when you had the conversation?",
    "ignoring this will not help things. there is no relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist.",
    "i know. i'm a typical man and i like the feeling when she is on my arm. i feel like the cat that has got the cream. it's superficial and sad i know. i knew this would never last. she is just too attractive for me. everyone told me iwas'punching above my weight'and now they will all be laughing if it ends.",
    "honestly, its not anyone else's business. if you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart__unk__ breaking 10. however should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o__unk__ is for the two of you. its a relationship, not a community project! even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best i can. is not more important that what matters most to you and her!",
    "i'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. she is always texting and vague when i ask who she is messaging. she goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when i called her office her colleague said they got back after two.",
    "that's just it. i kind of know she is cheating but i haven't approached it with her because i'm scared see will just leave and i'll be a laughing stock. i suppose i'm a joke either way!",
    "very true. i suppose i have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think i should just talk to her?",
    "not at all. i appreciate your candour.",
    "all this is tied up with who and i know i'm valuing the wrong things. you are right actually. i think some of this comes from my low self__unk__ esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe i need to deal with it directly.",
    "i am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines",
    "that's good",
    "yeah i have been procrast__unk__ and taking my sweet time with things since it's online and basically i do things on my own time.",
    "devoting full__unk__ time i mean",
    "have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one",
    "i have done both methods. i definitely prefer in__unk__ school studies.",
    "no it's just that it's a different avenue. i have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. i think it's because of the pandemic that has made me procrast__unk__ more and being aimless and slow.",
    "yeah i take breaks in between.",
    "like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm",
    "yea i have been missing the gym myself. now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day.",
    "and i know i can pass the courses and on time but just that i am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as i know i have done much better before. so i am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity.,",
    "i was also thinking i should have a regular workout routine at home again because i used to work out much more daily, even at home.",
    "thank you and i do agree with you on the pandemic. but this is a part of my mistake too but i think coming away from our conversation, i am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it.",
    "i see. hopefully your routines are much better and more productive now.",
    "yeah you've been more than helpful! thank you.",
    "thank you very much. and i hope you best of luck with all your endeavours!",
    "how ridiculous....",
    "hi i am sorry to hear that",
    "what are they trying to shame you with?",
    "they are putting me on a guilt trip. my one old friend is the president of a local non__unk__ profit.",
    "i am not making much income with the covid__unk__ 19, either.",
    "two different __unk__ so__unk__ called ) friends of mine need to get a life.",
    "shame on them to do that to you",
    "well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do.",
    "what should i do about these two __unk__ so__unk__ called ) friends?",
    "things were great, this time last year.",
    "i might be able to do that.",
    "well, i used to donate a lot in year's past.",
    "great point.",
    "my friends may like to know that i am trading time... __unk__ instead of donating money.",
    "yes, you make a good point.",
    "the proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight.",
    "i have pride, too.",
    "but it should be what you want not what your'fre__unk__ want.",
    "yeah......",
    "not sure how quickly the markets rebound....",
    "well if they do not believe you as well you might really need to rethink your friendships and the meaning in those so called freind ships.",
    "well, i usually go to their get__unk__ togethers. both of my friends are well__unk__ to__unk__ do.",
    "thank you. good bye.",
    "thanks i wish you all the luck and health",
    "happy holidays.",
    "same",
    "how are you today?",
    "__unk__ to do",
    "i'm not really sure what i'm doing wrong",
    "what can i do though?",
    "hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though",
    "yes.. __unk__ hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though.",
    "how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy",
    "this whole covid thing has me scrambling to talk to a live person",
    "ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done?",
    "i was in a physical office when i had this problem, but the boss rotated between offices. it was hard to wait, but i just kept my head down until the next time she was available.",
    "thank you. i'll give it a shot",
    "hrm.. __unk__ that's a good point! i hadn't thought of it that way",
    "hopefully that mindset can help you stay positive until you have the chance to speak with them, instead of worrying about what you've done wrong.",
    "well.. __unk__ i hope you have a wonderful night! thank you for all your help!",
    "yes i agree",
    "thank you for your help! me too. i'll try what you have suggested and see if that doesn't work out well. who knows, maybe it just my project that i'm on.",
    "i'm feeling pretty good right now.",
    "i have a friend who knew me since i was little. she is a little older than me. she still treat me like i'm still little. i tried to explain to her that i'm a grown woman and i grew out of lot of things when i was a kid.",
    "she still didn't get it. i want our relationship to move further but with her like this. i feel sad. is there anything i can do?",
    "that's true. i didn't think about it. should i approach her and talk about it before?",
    "yeah, that's definitely true. i know she is a good person. so i would give her a chance and we can talk about it before.",
    "she have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. she used to be only child for a while before her brother was born.",
    "maybe that's why. she have different personality than me. she is more into logical thinking and she love people and has bubbly personality. while i'm emotional but are social butterfly and after a while, i would need a break from people.",
    "to be honest, there are some times when she made me cry or mad when i get home. i think that over the time and the more older i get, the more i would knowledge my relationship with her.",
    "i do have other friends that i could purse the relationship farther. i think i just felt bad that i known her for years and she is a good person. it's just not what i need right now.",
    "sometimes we really just have to let things go. i know it's hard but it will probably good for your mental health.",
    "yeah, thank you! you certainly helped me.",
    "you too! stay safe and healthy!",
    "how about you?",
    "just want to talk some random stuff basically just want a companion",
    "still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there?",
    "i don't really know what to do anymore, i am just lazy on everything",
    "not really i'm living with my family but i don't really talk to them anymore i'm just in my room all day.",
    "it's something else",
    "just a fight from years ago and i decided to not talk to them anymore.",
    "that's completely your decision, but it can bring us down at times. what are you doing to stay positive during these crazy times in the world?",
    "i know, i should find a productive hobby",
    "like painting or learn new skills online like coding, anything that can improve my human capital",
    "i have a book, i mostly research in online if i can't understand it fully or watch youtube tutorials",
    "a month maybe, idk depends on how much i can handle it",
    "i know you can handle it. you speak very well and i just think you need a touch of motivation. we all do!",
    "sure, nice talking to you",
    "hello?",
    "i want to sleep all my problems away",
    "i got a hold of a therapist but they won't talk to me for two days",
    "i am hoping it helps because i feel helpless, especially today and on edge",
    "i can't sleep through the day because i have kids but when my ex gets home i just go hide and try to sleep so it's typically late afternoon",
    "i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over.",
    "yes it may be. i'm not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking.",
    "i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster",
    "that's true. i thought about maybe playing video games",
    "i haven't been playing them much",
    "i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late.",
    "that's a great idea. that may help a lot with focus.",
    "dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction.",
    "her series the chemical garden trilogy is my favorite",
    "that's also another good idea. i haven't read all of her bookis",
    "i do but they're closed because of covid",
    "the bookstores are open",
    "sorta but not that close but i can take the bus out there",
    "that's a great idea",
    "i try but i get too stresed",
    "thank you. that's true.",
    "thank you i will take that advcie",
    "im very upset",
    "then she showed up with her new boyfriend",
    "i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first",
    "yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was gone",
    "i'm so sorry that happened to you.",
    "i've known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they're not even officially together",
    "she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal",
    "she barely knows him.",
    "i have been in a similar situation with a friend and her husband; when he was exhibiiing bad behavior, she did not want to see it in him.",
    "last time we went out for brunch, he literally tried to make her pay for it! that's not the behavior of someone that has money like she claims. she's delusional",
    "im thinking of calling the cops",
    "i think if you talk to her again and tell her you are looking out for her best interests it may help open a conversation.",
    "i think she is working with him, maybe, or at least covering for him",
    "i think she would cover him, maybe, or try to avoid the truth. but no i dont think she would plot with him",
    "it sounds like you really care about your friend, and want the best for her.",
    "i'm sure she'll come forward if i give her time. thank you for your help",
    "i hope that she does the right thing and that you can stay friends.",
    "i am really fearful about my job situation.",
    "the current economic climate has really made me fearful... __unk__ not sure if i am going to be able to keep my job.",
    "somewhat. but, my fears are relevant because i don't know if i will always have a job.",
    "do you know what i mean?",
    "you take alooonnng time to respond.",
    "ok, i will look some of them online. i need some financial planners to help as well. many americans are hurting.",
    "i will have to try that. maybe it can help me ease my mind.",
    "since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job.",
    "i think a side hustle could work, perhaps?",
    "childhood traumas are tough for sure. i am a fearful person.",
    "i think that your advice will help. thank you for the chat.",
    "thank you. good bye.",
    "i am fine thank you. how are you?",
    "yes. i am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend.",
    "her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. he was high on drugs at the time. my dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. he was often the driver not my friend. was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? did my friend know he was on drugs?",
    "agreed but it is hard to not be suspicious that the mom knew something about hi actions. yet i feel horrible that she lost her husband.",
    "i know. i am trying to be supportive and help her with her kids but a part of me is still anxious that she may have played me.",
    "very true. i really never even considered that!",
    "no, absolutely not! but i never looked at it that way.",
    "yes. i am very relieved. he was recently in a car accident before he died. luckily no one was hurt and the girls were not in the car! he totaled his brand new truck though.",
    "definitely trying to be!",
    "yes she received payouts from several large life insurance policies so they are safe financially. just a mess emotionally.",
    "maybe it can be a good opportunity for her to change her lifestyle and get off the drugs",
    "thank you so much! you were very helpful!",
    "you're welcome : ) __unk__ you need to quit your end; i can't from this end : ) )",
    "hi, how are you?",
    "i'm feeling really anxious these days. i'm finding the covid online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. i want to stop school, but i don't think i can afford to. i need to get done with school.",
    "school was always hard. now it's gotten harder. i think a lot of people are stressed.",
    "last semester and this semester. it feels like a lot longer though.",
    "a balance in life. i spend so much time online. i'm always staring at a screen. i would like to get aware from the computer.",
    "yeah, i can't wait for things to return to normal. until then, i don't know what i can do to feel normal.",
    "no, i haven't. i thought it wouldn't be the same as really hanging out. i don't drink. i do like to play board games though.",
    "that's true. i wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren't interested. it's not the same thing to play with strangers.",
    "that's great. i wish i had kept in touch with my friends from those days. i'm not really much for just socializing though. i like some kind of activity, like games.",
    "ok. not really sure how to form a group. i want to reach out, but so many people are flaky. they makes plans then bail at the last minute.",
    "ok. will do. i'll see what i can get done. thanks for your help.",
    "have a good day!",
    "hello. is anyone there",
    "i'm doing good. i need some advice",
    "lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. they even called my face as flat as a pan! what should i do? i see them everyday on the bus",
    "i did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that i'm handsome. but it's starting to get on my nerves because it's all they make fun about every time they see me!",
    "what do you think i should do then?",
    "i understand, school was tough for me too.",
    "should i just beat them up with my backpack",
    "there's another bus route. should i just take that instead",
    "i think i will. their comments make me very insecure",
    "you could also tell a teacher what is happening. they will help you out.",
    "thanks it's hard to look in the mirror now",
    "do you believe working out will help",
    "awesome. i will start to take care of myself and not worry about others then.",
    "hi",
    "i do not know how to tell my husband that i am lonely and i want out of the marriage",
    "he is not one you can talk to he usually just brushes things off",
    "yes he tells me it__unk__ s just in my head and i could just go out with him, but he drinks then to much so i do not like going out with him",
    "and he hangs with some obnoxious people",
    "he would go to sleep, and then he thinks i am crazy he says we are no kids anymore that need to go on a date we are married",
    "i turned this situation in every direction and i just am not able to find a solution",
    "well, what about you finding a counselor for yourself who could help you with your own self__unk__ care? perhaps it could be a start and then he__unk__ she could help you end your marriage if you still want to.",
    "maybe you are right i might get then some self esteem as well again",
    "thank you you are very kind",
    "i was reallly worried in this suitation",
    "was not so good",

    "i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me",

    "i agree 100%. been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot",
    "i currently do that. it's hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money",
    "absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out.",

    "bad cycle",
    "time is the fire in which we burn.",
    "the pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality",

    "oh i am sorry to hear that.",
    "has the pandemic affected your work life at all?",
    "so he missed quite a bit of work",
    "that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that",
    "it was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out",
    "just from talking to you i can see that it was very stressing for you",
    "oh yes it defintely was. he is out again because i just tested positive for covid. so he will be out of work for two weeks",
    "he has never tested positive. i tested positive. just anytime you get any kind of sickness his work makes you take time off just in case you have covid. he has been tested 3 different times and it has always been negative.",
    "thats okay",
    "i am a very anxious person. not sure why.",
    "i am nervous at times too and i usually try to take a break and do something i find comfort in when i feel like that. i can't imagine how siffuc__unk__ must be for you to feel like this often",
    "i am trying to not let things stress me out as much.",
    "yes most of the time.",
    "that sounds awesome",
    "good how are you",
    "just been having a rough time... __unk__ recently broke up with my girlfriend.",
    "trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. it is hard to escape the sadness.",
    "yeah it is. well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. we tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. i was the one who broke things off because i know longer felt much love coming from her. i felt neglected and i thought a break up was the best solution. i did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. i was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts.",
    "yeah it has been difficult and i know i will make it through. it is just difficult to get through break ups these days. unless you disconnect you can't avoid the other person.",
    "yeah i was thinking of maybe organizing a hunting__unk__ fishing__unk__ camping trip with my buddies over winter break. that could help get me out of the digital world and would help me spend quality time with my friends.",
    "yeah i think that is probably what i will end up doing. it will probably help the mental health of the entire friend group, but especially me right now.",
    "thank you for the help and the advice. i think i will follow through and make the trip happen. any tips on eventually getting back out in the dating game in these strange times?",
    "i appreciate your help with this situation.",
    "hello",
    "just feeling sad",
    "plus my hours were cut at work.",
    "i completely understand. i am also going through the same. i have not left my house in weeks. while i am able to work from home, my hours were also cut.",
    "i tend to watch tv and lot and watch youtube videos. nothing productive.",
    "yes, i have one close friend that i talk to every now and then. its not like it use to be.",
    "we used to be able to go out and have a few beers together.",
    "i hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm.",
    "good idea..",
    "i like to do home repairs. maybe i can find a group for that.",
    "do you use any other social media for connecting with new people.",
    "i use facebook, instagram, and sometimes tiktok",
    "true. i have to change out a few old style electrical plugs. maybe i can do something on that?",
    "i saw a few tiktok videos but never post a video. is it hard to post on there?",
    "oh. okay.",
    "but you can also record it straight to the app.",
    "i never used snapchat. is that the one disappears after some time.?",
    "yes, if you are doing longer videos, i recommend youtube. what you can do, is do a short clip on tiktoc and then in that clip instruct viewers to follow your youtube channel",
    "wow. thanks for all the great information.",
    "hi",
    "well i'm distra__unk__",
    "because my girlfriend has left me",
    "that must be really hard for you. i haven't personally had to deal with that, but i have had friends that have.",
    "four years",
    "well i'm not really, especially as she'd gone off with someone else. but i'm to blame which makes it worse",
    "i cheated on her on a drunken night. it was a one__unk__ off and i regret it terribly. but she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain.",
    "i see how she would be upset. it must be difficult for you though because she didn't give you another chance.",
    "but no, not really. no__unk__ one who would understand",
    "i would have wanted a second chance too if i were in your shoes.",
    "yeah i feel so low",
    "if your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected.",
    "it's difficult though, to open up",
    "it is. but trust me, it really helps. i've been seeing a therapist recently actually and i love it. i don't have to worry about judgement at all.",
    "they won't think i'm to blame?",
    "oh yeah, that's a good point",
    "no you've been helpful thanks",
    "thanks x",
    "but you helped with my problem promptly",
    "i feel really sad all the time. i don't know why.",
    "hello",
    "i'm not sure. i can't find a reason. my health is fine. i have friends. i have a place to live.",
    "yes, that's right. i feel like my life is not going in the right direction. in fact, i'm not going anywhere.",
    "no, not really. i don't know what to talk about. i just feel flat. something's wrong. i don't know what.",
    "how did you do that? i really need some guidance here. what do i do?",
    "i can't spend all my time with my friends, of course. they have things to do. so do i.",
    "i'm trying to be positive. it doesn't seem to work. i don't know how to change my mood without chemicals.",
    "no, i haven't tried yoga. i thought it was for women. therapy? you mean like a shrink?",
    "oh, meditating by myself? i would need someone to help me learn. is yoga expensive? i don't have much money.",
    "ok. i'll check out youtube. do i need special clothes or equipment? or incense or candles or lotoins or something? i'm just a regular guy.",
    "have a great day!",
    "i hope it work for you",
    "hello, how are you?",
    "i'm alright, honestly i'm feeling rather ashamed. the reason for that and the problem that i'm facing is that i've had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and i'm only 24 years old. right now in my life i'm ready to seek help, but i'm having a lot of anxiety about it because i'm very worried about how others will judge me. i'm worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that i will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. i'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that i've made that have gotten me here and i guess my problem is that i just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that i can just finally make the step that i need so desperately and get help.",
    "i am in a good position to help you as i am in the same situation. please know you are not alone.",
    "i would definitely recommend seeking help sooner rather than later!",
    "i really know that that's what i need to do, and i am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know",
    "no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when i actual do it",
    "trust me everyone will be very sympathetic : ). everyone there will be in the same place",
    "and quite a bit, about half a gallon or more a day. and thank you, i really do appreciate your help. i know that and i know its time for me to better my life because its no way to live ya know. id like to grow up and have a normal life __unk__ :",
    "thank you, i do feel better about going now. i just dont know what to expect and it can be scary sometimes",
    "you will be treated with respect at all times.",
    "you might even find that you make some new friends : )",
    "you're right, and that's what i probably need also is some friends who are in similar positions",
    "they'd understand my situation more, and be good influences",
    "of course, you really have. i appreciate your advice, it really did help calm my mind about the whole situation. thank you again __unk__ :",
    "yes of course",
    "i have anxiety about what avenue to take academically",
    "i do have an idea about it but i am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something i wish i hadn't chosen",
    "fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time",
    "but what if that thing is your career choice?",
    "that is a totally normal aspect of human nature. it's normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point",
    "thank you for your help",
    "no problem, and it's great that you like helping others.",
    "i agree with you on that",
    "remember to always keep a positive mindset. i am sure you will sort this out in no time.",
    "are you still there",
    "yes, sorry",
    "why does it say im ending the chat early when it has been enough time already",
    "trying to keep my head afloat",
    "i lost my job some months back and it hasn't really been easy for me",
    "i am sorry to hear that, loss of income can be very stressful.",
    "yes. its been months now and nothing yet",
    "and i'm pretty sure they must be fed up",
    "yes i have. that's what helps with feeding and getting some little things at home.",
    "and sometimes i pay back little of what they loan me since i know i cant pay all of it",
    "i babysit sometimes",
    "like an outcast",
    "okay. thanks",
    "sometimes when i have to much free time on my hands i start to feel the same but when i find away to fill the time i no longer feel useless.",
    "cause at this point, i think i'm going to lose it",
    "i am feeling very sad",
    "my partner of 9 months cheated on me.",
    "it is over permanently...",
    "maybe is it for the best now that i think about it.",
    "yeah i just miss having someone there for me.",
    "what is tlc",
    "there will be someone else. i never thought i'd find anyone else but i did and we've been together ten years ago now!",
    "ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. maybe this was needed in order to find the right person",
    "i am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money",
    "do you have any tips onto how i can make more money/",
    "but i guess it ads up",
    "i am going to wait for this whole covid thing to end and then get a real job and once i fix my financial situation i will start dating again",
    "yeah exactly and i have more pressing matters at hand than a girlfriend because like i said, i am in need of money right now since",
    "i am feeling happy right now",
    "how can i make sure you get the most money from this",
    "and then we started going on dates and we both seemed to like each other",
    "yeah it really makes it easy to meet new people",
    "not like when i was younger when the internet was just taking off. internet dating was seen as weird then",
    "bye",
    "bye",
    "hello. feeling low today.",
    "i've been remote working for the entire pandemic. at first, it was great. i didn't go into the office very often before, so i felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. but now i wonder if i am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction.",
    "yes. i can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. but when i interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. i feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions.",
    "i often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. i have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. challenging face__unk__ to__unk__ face, and i have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way.",
    "thank you for sharing that. i have a better understanding now __unk__ what you feel is very valid, and i am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year.",
    "most often, i work independently my work. involves a lot of explaining and justification. before we just all sat in the same room and worked together.",
    "my current work is in the finance section. prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. it is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap.",
    "so, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues?",
    "ah, something more casual?",
    "that's a great idea! i would love to get a care package, actually!",
    "i will pass these suggestions on! have a great holiday season!",
    "that is good to hear. i am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called how to be antiracist. it can serve as both learning and bonding purposes.",
    "hello, i'm not sure if there is any help? without knowing when i can return to work, i will probably remain anxious about the unknown",
    "i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers",
    "i can understand how you might feel anxious. there are lots of uncertainties right now. i am sorry you are going through this.",
    "thank you; fortunately, i have been able to collect unemployment assistance, especially created for self employed people during this difficult time. however, that is due to expire in a few weeks, so once again i am growing anxious about finances",
    "yes, i try to walk outdoors every day, for at least 30 minutes. it does help a lot. but with the weather turning colder, that may be difficult to continue",
    "not yet; it is very difficult for me to ask for help. but i may need to do so in the near future. i am fortunate to have a close network of family and friends that i can count on",
    "i would be open to seeking other employment online; work from home on the computer. any suggestions?",
    "thanks! i will check it out. in the meantime, any other suggestions for dealing with anxiety?",
    "ok will do; thanks again for all the helpful info.",
    "take care, and happy holidays!",
    "i am just a little angry. my mother and i had another blow__unk__ up.",
    "it is why i am angry. this occurs at least every other day. i say something harmless and she thinks i am saying it in a way that is rude or something.",
    "i do not know for sure where to start. if i try to tell her that is not what i mean it is like she doesn't understand?",
    "for example today i was just saying i like the food she had cooked us for supper. she took that to mean i never liked the food she made before. she says i do not appreciate her and i should be grateful to have her.",
    "maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive.",
    "but they should not take how they feel on others right? but i know i have to be understanding.",
    "can you relate to this situation?",
    "maybe i could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before i respond.",
    "i guess the best time to do that was when she is in a very good mood.",
    "but what if she thinks me helping her out is criticizing the way she does things? that seems like the way she would be.",
    "i will try this. it is worth a shot. we can't go through life being upset at each other.",
    "i appreciated the help. i was just so upset. i didn't want to talk to anyone in our family and have them take sides or make them uncomfortable.",
    "i will try to say things that don't sound confrontational from now on.",
    "thank you for the believing in me. thank you for your help.",
    "hello. maybe you can help me calm down. i just found out that i'm losing my job in january. __unk__ 1 )",
    "hello! i hope i can.",
    "yes and that worries me even more. more people competing for the same jobs. __unk__ 2 )",
    "that's a fare worry but you can't be discourged. you need to think positively.",
    "i will have to do a new resume definitely. it's been awhile. __unk__ 3 )",
    "i'll have to think on that, i have a friend that might be able to help but it's been awhile for both of us __unk__ 4 )",
    "well i don't think they are hobbies, but there are things that need to be done around the house. guess i can keep myself busy at least __unk__ 5 )",
    "that's really helpful! staying busy is good.",
    "yes, but i know i'll also have a lot of work to do to get ready to find a new job. i'm really hoping i can find one before i lose this one __unk__ 6 )",
    "i looked at indeed and i did apply to one thing. but when it came back to me it said that 4970 other people had applied for the same job! __unk__ 7 )",
    "i wish i knew how to make myself stand out more. so many people are out there looking for work. __unk__ 8 )",
    "i'm an accountant __unk__ 9 )",
    "well, with numbers at least! i just worry about companies that aren't able to be open, well they won't need an accountant. __unk__ 10 )",
    "hello",
    "i am not feeling the best. i have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic.",
    "i try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person.",
    "yes. that works for some of my family but i have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. i haven't seen them in several months. it just breaks my heart.",
    "yes. i have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. i guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that i haven't got to spend it with my extended family members.",
    "yeah. i have a little dog that has been my cuddle buddy. i have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. what are some things you do to deal with depression?",
    "that sounds like some good advice. i think i will try to find a good podcast or a good comedy series that i like and spend time doing that. it's hard to be sad when you are watching something funny or listening to something funny. thank you for the good advice and the listening ear.",
    "that is so true. i guess we tend to feel guilty if we feel happy since there is so much sadness in the world right now. but you are so right about the fact that we will come out on the other side. it helps to remember that bad things don't last forever.",
    "yes. i live in the country so i can go for nice walks when the weather is nice. staying safe is definitely important right now.",
    "yes that is exactly what i do. thank you so much for your help today. you have made me feel better just having someone to vent to.",
    "yes. it the weather is very pretty here today. as a matter of fact, i think i am fixing to go for a nice walk. i hope you have a wonderful day and thank you for listening.",
    "hi",
    "i am not doing so great. i fell down some stairs the other day and broke my foot and chipped my two front teeth.",
    "i am grateful for my family they are taking care of me but i am on crutches and am in a boot when i am not icing my foot",
    "yes i am struggling with some depression just because i am feeling a bit isolated with the broken foot along with covid going on.",
    "thank you i appreciate that! yes i am getting surgery like 2 days before christmas so this christmas should definitely be interesting to say the least haha.",
    "yes exactly. i got my teeth fixed a couple days ago as well so that was good too! i am really leaning on my family for support but just felt like asking for some outside help which is why i am talking to you right now lol.",
    "i think i pretty much got everything i need from you- i just needed to vent i think. so we can stop talking now or whenever you have to leave",
    "you too!",
    "hello",
    "i am okay just anxious",
    "i believe i am going to fail all my finals for college",
    "yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus.",
    "that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks",
    "i try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus",
    "i also take 20 minute power naps because i have read somewhere it helps",
    "yes i live with a roommate and we are in the same program, but i sometimes feel dumb when i study with her",
    "i also forget to eat sometimes because im so stressed",
    "i also felt that way around finals and with friends, i think it's important to recognize this is one semester and that it's equally as important to take care of yourself as it is to pass those finals.",
    "yes thats the only thing that is keeping me going. this is only for a few days and it will soon end and i will have a break",
    "thank you so much, i feel relieved. i will take all your suggestions into consideration.",
    "from what i've seen, you're not alone in that feeling. it's a natural fear for just about anyone approaching something new. but there really aren't any rules, your life and your decisions decide your success.",
    "hi, sarah. i am at my wits end. i feel like i am going crazy.",
    "i am stressed out about having to move and i just can't seem to calm down when it is time to sleep.",
    "i am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then.",
    "i usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while i watch tv before i head to bed.",
    "yes, i am a homeschooling mother of two.",
    "have you tried a warm bath before bed? that's helped me before. meditation to still my mind before sleeping helps too.",
    "a bath does sound really relaxing. i have tried some meditations.",
    "thanks, i will have to try that. music does tend to calm me down. i don't know why i haven't tried that.",
    "it's guided sleep meditations, and his voice is incredibly soothing... __unk__ works well for me on nights i can't naturally fall asleep.",
    "i think it will be easier to focus on a meditation with someone talking me through it",
    "so i have been alone to stew in my worries.",
    "oh i see so right now you're the main __unk__ parent__unk__ er\"?",
    "i really appreciate your support today. it is helpful to talk it out. your suggestions were also really good.",
    "you have a great day : )",
    "bye",
    "hello, i am looking for help in managing some depression.",
    "you've come to a good place to start.",
    "my son's behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us",
    "i have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. it's hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future.",
    "i have an adult son who also lost his job recently, and i understand the added stress that can cause in your household.",
    "my son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn't willing to work or even help out around the house",
    "i try to go for a run every night, that does help.",
    "it is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him",
    "that is very understandable! setting boundaries for yourself may help. even when it's difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help.",
    "i do struggle with expectations. i want him to be someone that he is not willing to be, i need to let go of that and just let him be himself and not base my emotions on his choices.",
    "i feel guilty sometimes taking time to do things that i like and that are away from my family. i can see that i need to do that more, though.",
    "thank you, it is helpful to know that other people have felt the same way.",
    "thank you!",
    "you are certainly not alone.",
    "hello",
    "yes __unk__ i feel like i am in depsression.",
    "my partner broke up with me impromptu",
    "oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair.",
    "how did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism?",
    "well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. its not easy, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. its what gives us depth and character as human beings.",
    "it is very pathetic really when you think of it __unk__ halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended.",
    "close friends can really be helpful in such situations __unk__ yes __unk__ i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up.",
    "i see what you mean about pathetic lol. but rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world.",
    "yes __unk__ i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of",
    "i have to get better no matter what __unk__ are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation?",
    "is there any particular resource you can refer me to?",
    "waiting __unk__ thank you",
    "could you just name a few then i can look them up on my own later?",
    "ok that's rather helpful",
    "will definitely check it out",
    "i feel better and ready to face the world",
    "hello. it is a fine day, how about yourself?",
    "that is awesome.",
    "sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright.",
    "i wanted to talk about a personal issue i have been having, though.",
    "my father and i had a fight 2 years ago and haven't spoke since.",
    "yeah i am afraid that these things can happen. it was only over material things.",
    "it is weird because i called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense.",
    "i would likely take advantage of an opportunity to be the bigger person.",
    "that is probably decent advice.",
    "i hope so too, but the opportunity seems tenuous",
    "threatening and disparagement haha",
    "i'm a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week.",
    "he got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction.",
    "i had a neighbor who was doing meth, and he got arrested, and that actually saved his life. he had to get sober and look at what he was doing.",
    "sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. he's such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost",
    "he has alienated all of his friends, including me. i was the last one holding on",
    "i agree, i'm afraid that's what i have to do. another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. i don't want to lose another friend.",
    "yes. i know i have to let go. i've punished myself trying to stay in his life.",
    "it's just rotting his soul and body. he believes he can't stop and you're right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now",
    "very evil, i agree, i like to write out a list of things i can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. like i take time to think about them and pray for them, then i have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where i want to go and how to get there. even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol",
    "that's a good idea. i don't have many friends left, close friends that is, and this guy is my best friend of 20 years. we were in a touring rock band together. he's my last close friend.",
    "it is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. maybe you can write that on your list __unk__ - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. that way you open up yourself to make new friends.",
    "i'm a single dad so my world is my children. i guess that's enough for me really. i just watch this guy sink and often feel like i should be doing something, but i think you're right.",
    "hi rose. i'm ok, but i get embarrassed about my curly hair",
    "what about your hair is embarrasing exactly? curls seem like a lovely thing to have __unk__ mine is dead straight, lets trade lol ) but no, seriously, what in particular don't you like about it?",
    "they are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. often get frizzy by the end of the day. it get's frustrating when i always look a mess.",
    "oh i could see that being frustrating, if you can't keep them neat.",

    "yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fianc\u00e9. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house.",
    "yes, felling very stuck.",
    "it's completely normal to feel that way. i'm sure you're handling the situation as best as you can.",
    "trying to, looking for every way possible to make money and save it up and move out. really dont want to have to partition the property as its the house we grew up in.",
    "i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there.",
    "if he's in a certain mindset, it would be hard to change that.",
    "right? and his fianc\u00e9 is the same way, they are both alcoholics and spend most of their income on their habits. its all i can do right now to keep food in the house, let alone running water.",
    "i think it would be good for you to talk to someone and get help.",
    "i have a couple of friends that i have talked to about it, but it just seems like i am screaming at a brick wall and nothing changes.",
    "i would suggest talking to a therapist if your insurance can handle that!",
    "is it normal to always feel helpless? cause thats how its been. either rip everything to shreds or do nothing.",
    "yes it is. especially now. i just want to encourage to keep pushing. think about yourself in a year or two from now. do everything you can right now to get out of the situation. if it gets really bad, don't be afraid to call out for help __unk__ like the police ). stay safe and do what's best for you.",
    "police are a very bad idea where i live. they will not prosecute family violence without also prosecuting me. i live in texas, if i press charges, the state will press charges against me. i have several scars from incidents where they told me as such. its really a loosing battle where the law is concerned here.",
    "thank you for listening tho. it is nice to talk to someone outside of my normal circle about these things. : )",
    "thank you. i apprecieate it.",
    "hello there, can i help you with any today?",
    "__unk__ anything",
    "i am having such a difficult time today!!!",
    "i think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!!",
    "he has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt.",
    "we tried counselling once.. it was online and we got paid to do it.. i don't think he took it seriously at the time. he always said he felt like he was being attacked.",
    "yes. i feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place.",
    "i have been as well but this time was supposed to be different. at first everything was great but now things are so distant i just don't know what to do next.",
    "that is true. but now we have a kid together and i feel like it would break her heart to lose her dad",
    "can you recomend a good site to find affordable services?",
    "that is a great idea i had not thought of asking my dr.",
    "they should be able to provide you with a list of reputable services local to you.",
    "absolutely best advice i have gotten in a while. it was nice talking to you.",
    "online learning is not seems easy, seems i am going to fail this year",
    "in__unk__ class learning was way better and i learned a lot but now its so confusing",
    "even working with online tools is hard",
    "i know but what is i loose a whole year in academic,",
    "think positive my dear friend",
    "but i have been in low grades continuously during my last semesters.",
    "just have the confidence within yourselves and believe in you, that is the most important thing",
    "well it is still hard to understand online learning tools",
    "i tried that but i am not tech savy",
    "why cant you seek help from a friend of yours who studies well?",
    "i shall try to learn from youtube more maybe that is the only solution for online learning",
    "you dont have to meet a lot of people, but atleast one or two of your friends with all the safety measures? who could really help you __unk__ and also one of the best solution can be group studies as well",
    "hello",
    "not so good. how are you doing?",
    "yes. well today i had a delivery order. so i went to mcdonald's and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours i notice that the client did not confirm the order.",
    "so now i don't know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job",
    "of course i did. he told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad",
    "i understand, but do not feel bad about yourself. you did your work honestly and delivered the food to your customer.",
    "sure. that can help. i would appreciate it",
    "maybe every time you make a delivery, you can take a picture of it for proof.",
    "well. i normally take pictures of every delivery i make but i let this pass and look what happened",
    "it's okay, it happens to everyone. we are human and we tend to make the smallest mistakes. the important thing is to learn from them.",
    "well. this is the first time i ever faced this kind of problem at work",
    "i know but sometimes one small thing can hurt you and ruined the reputation that you had build for a long time",
    "thank you very much for taking your time and encouraging me with your words",
    "yes you did. god bless you and have a good one",
    "i'm really depressed. my fiance left me yesterday.",
    "yes, i think that might make me feel better. i really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn't like him so they think this is for the best.",
    "i just don't understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave",
    "yes, i feel very betrayed.",
    "they're making things worse for me.",
    "he left yesterday. i had no warning. he just packed up all his stuff and said he didn't want to marry me and the last year has been a lie.",
    "i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take you to feel better?",
    "what did you do to help feel better>",
    "i thought we would be spending the next week together at home.",
    "hopefully. i could really use to sit down with a friend right now and spend some quality time. i don't want to be alone all week.",
    "thanks for chatting with me. i feel a little more relaxed now.",
    "hello",
    "i am ok so far",
    "and need some inspiration",
    "and money issues",
    "my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough",
    "yeah me too",
    "yeah mostly working and meditation",
    "i mostly do it sporadically but i do need to do it more often",
    "so true",
    "i like that thank you for the tip i must use that more often",
    "no that will be thanx for listening to me",
    "hello, how are you?",
    "hello",
    "i'm doing well, but it could have been better",
    "yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and i'm kind of getting tired, i don't want to play games anymore",
    "exactly, i hate to feel that i'm wasting my time",
    "yes, i love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn't want that for me i would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run.",
    "yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, i don't want it to look like i'm pushing him if i try to talk to him again about it. his nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, i'm just not happy.",
    "that is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance i am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications.",
    "i hope you are right, just don't want to come across as a desperate person and that's why i'm setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time.",
    "you need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself!",
    "you are right, that's exactly what i'm going to do because the wait is killing me.",
    "thank you very much, you've been a great help",
    "thanks, it was nice chatting with you.",
    "no problem, take care.",
    "hello",
    "i am suffering from low mood and general depression. i don't know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down __unk__ obviously ) and there doesn't appear to be any real reason behind it.",
    "i felt this way for a while actually isn't a recent change it's been building slowly over time.",
    "i think i know what you mean. it's getting worse. i feel very down.",
    "yeah. i worry that i'll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. i'm really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest.",
    "any suggestions on what to do about it?",
    "ok well there is definitely a problem.",
    "not really i don't want to bother other people with my problems.",
    "yeah maybe. i suppose nobody really understands but i could at least speak to them about it.",
    "i don't want to feel like this anymore. i'm willing to at least give it a go.",
    "i haven't spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear i don't want any medication.",
    "yes that's right i don't want to take any pills or anything like that.",
    "what do you mean be a rude day.",
    "ok thanks for explaining. i think i'll speak to my sister about this. if this doesn't help i'll look into making an appointment with the psychologist maybe.",
    "thanks for that.",
    "i am really feeling the loneliness of the season and being isolated.",
    "good evening",
    "are we out of time",
    "just no family around",
    "the virus this year does not help.",
    "are you affected by the virus",
    "have you thought about setting up some video calls with your family during the holidays? i know a lot of people are doing that so they can feel closer to the family during these tough times/",
    "i thought about he videos but my daughter lives in california",
    "i have to arrange with her because she does not i am moving. it will bother her.",
    "as a result i am having a hard time sleeping",
    "that makes me feel a lot better. have you ever lost your job?",
    "what helped you get through it?",
    "i had a bit in savings, but i looked for new jobs mostly. i was on unemployment insurance for about a month before i found a new job.",
    "have you made any plans yet about how to move forward?",
    "what kind of tools would you recommend i use to get through this",
    "well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. if you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. it's really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own.",
    "are there any meds you can recommend to help me sleep?",
    "wow! i've never used melatonin before. did it really help you? are you doing much better now?",
    "it defiitely helps me fall asleep.",
    "it's a natural sleep aid.",
    "it's been really nice talking to you",
    "no i'm okay. i think that's everything : )",
    "you too : ) thanks __unk__ 3",
    "hi there, are you free to talk? i am feeling rather sad.",
    "i feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me.",
    "do you think that i am over__unk__ reacting? i do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while.",
    "we went out for coffee the other day and i thought about saying something cos i know they went to a club without me last weekend but i couldn't bring myself to in the end.",
    "sometimes in the past i have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. could it be that they just did not think that i wanted to go?",
    "the thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. i just feel i am no longer a part of the group.",
    "i don't know. i don't want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. sometimes i think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends.",
    "it is making me really depressed and is badly damaging my sense of self worth. i feel as though i am not worth anyone's time.",
    "thank you that is helpful. what if i reach out and they all snub me though?",
    "anyway i do appreciate your help - you have given me things to think about.",
    "i cant go back to uni due to finacial issue",
    "good afternnon.",
    "as i stated i had to cut university short and i feel like am going to finish old",
    "mid twenties",
    "oh do you feel like you under achieved like you do better",
    "maybe but this is not the first time prosponding",
    "oh that sounds great. sometimes i feel like god is my only ally and friend",
    "yes i have",
    "i just hope he holds me through this too, i give myself hope that he let this happen for a reason",
    "wow",
    "he will see you through just keep a positive attitude.",
    "computer engineering and information technology",
    "i know what i am after, just have to be persistent.",
    "thank you",
    "but next year am considering part time",
    "pick up work. i had a scholarship but it got cancelled when my grades dropped a bit",
    "that's the plan next year. i have 2 more years to go",
    "but don't give up what you started",
    "actually started saving up now for school next year",
    "just never give up. two years will go by quickly if you keep attending.",
    "yea am looking for every possible help i can get. but thank you so much. this was helpful",
    "hello! how are you today?",
    "friends and our relationships amongst one another. two are arguing and i want to help both. we only can facetime each other because of corona and it is taking a toll among our group.",
    "my friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken.",
    "i believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful how do i help them?",
    "well, it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other.",
    "she went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think.",
    "how do i make her understand this?",
    "thanks! what should i say to her?",
    "sometimes the best way to help someone understand is to give them a little time and space. trying to force someone to understand doesn't always work.",
    "i think i will tell everyonr in our circle to fall back and let her come to us when she is ready.",
    "you could also try talking to your hurt friend like this and ask her if she thinks the other friend truly meant to hurt her. i bet she knows that wasn't the case.",
    "she knws this but nonetheless feels violated. i think your first piece of advice is great though. i will use this and thanks! have a good one.",
    "hello how are you?",
    "i am doing well just dealing with some problems with my friends",
    "friends not being there for me when i need emotional support. they also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well.",
    "yes that is exactly it. just sucks not having that emotional support",
    "i have and it seems that they just tell me what i would like to hear! it sucks when i am always there for them when they need me but they cannot do the same.",
    "it's good to know that i am not the only one going through this. what is your advice from experience with this?",
    "my grandma mostly who is an experienced family therapist but she is going through her own stuff as well.",
    "that is definitely helpful. i will look into being more productive and also doing more hobbies around the house to help clear my mind. any hobbies that you do now that really help?",
    "sounds good to me. i will take up building something.. __unk__ maybe turn it into a business as well. thank you for the advice.",
    "hi there, are you free to talk?",
    "i have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. it would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse.",
    "he was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia.",
    "i presume you mean now and not not ; ). though i simply am not a believer. it just made me think how meaningless life was.",
    "i do not really know what to do about my feelings. they are not going away.",
    "i think that what you said there was very wise. maybe it's worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that.",
    "whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, i think that it would hurt more if i had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day.",
    "it is just - very hard. i keep thinking about all the times i disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and i never got to tell him how much i loved him.",
    "your dad wouldn't want to see you grieving everyday either. you should live the way you know he'd love to see",
    "i know that he did : ). i had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. he did not get to enjoy his retirement!",
    "yes. i think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun.",
    "i can't really afford to have therapy at the moment. also i know that my dad was just have considered it to be a waste of money - he was very careful with money.",
    "that is a really sensible suggestion and it cheers me up to think of it. you have been a really great help to me.",
    "hi, i'm ok. how are you?",
    "that's great. my job refused my request to continue to work from home. so i was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing.",
    "i fear that i will bring this home to my family and i will not survive it. i have pre existing conditions.",
    "i'm sorry that you're having to deal with such stressful circumstances. you can only control what you can control. have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions?",
    "yes i have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my rheumatologist.",
    "teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. i can't quit because there not much to go into now",
    "is there someone else you could go to about this? besides whoever you've already attempted to discuss it with?",
    "i've tried contacting hr a few times but i have never received a call back, or my emails answered.",
    "very true. i'm going to keep trying. thanks for talking with me letting out what i feel has made me feel a little better.",
    "it really did help i feel a bit lighter. thank you again.",
    "i am doing well. my marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week.",
    "absolutely not. i'm not even in california yet, where i know my usage will explode. it's just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana",
    "yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user.",
    "it was recently legalized in our state. my wife and i were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. it is a major part of our lives.",
    "one of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. i'm very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially.",
    "it varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. which you of course have a version of in the uk. mayoral elections were today yeah?",
    "i guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections",
    "oh, i take it to mean that you are anti__unk__ khan? if you feel like you'd need to vote for mayor in london",
    "jeremy corbyn, no surrender?",
    "you sound like someone i'd like to smoke a spliff with in a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic i opened with",
    "ironic given that i just watched my fair lady the other day",
    "you've got those weird drug shops in the uk, with synthetics and all that",
    "let me guess - north__unk__ eastern uk?",
    "i have a slightly deeper knowledge of the uk than most americans. i binged derry girls in 2 days so my expertise is almost professorial here",
    "haha!",
    "only connect?",
    "legally",
    "i hope one day your people find liberation i think you have helped me a lot with my marijuana problem",
    "goodbye",
    "hello",
    "i feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help",
    "sometimes i get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything i'm doing, like i can't do anything more",
    "i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months.",
    "yes that's very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now",
    "but covid definitely plays a factor",
    "a few months ago i was feeling the same way. i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs. i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred",
    "yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one",
    "wow that's great",
    "i think it says the account doesn't exist when i try to login now",
    "sure i guess i'll have to do that but i really wanted to get back into that account, don't want to lose contact with that girl that was helping me",
    "do you mean um... __unk__ cheap med? cerebral seems to be an antidepressant when i googled",
    "oh wait nevermind i spoke too soon",
    "yeah definitely, i should try contacting their support to try and restore my account",
    "they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there!",
    "online is convenient but its just too much going on",
    "right...",
    "its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps",
    "hope you have a nice night and stay healthy, you and your family",
    "thanks, you too, bye",
    "can you please help??",
    "i am in a crisis at my job",
    "january 15th is my last day",
    "i will get pay for the last two weeks of january, 2021.",
    "what do you suppose i do? looks like the company has been hot hard by covid__unk__ 19 lockdowns.",
    "for 5 years. i work in accounting.",
    "yeah, but i was a good accountant.",
    "yeah, i have not told my wife about it just yet.",
    "i agree, this country has got some issues but we can get through them",
    "yeah, i am not sure. i better wait to break the news in 2021.",
    "and i am not the only one who is losing my job. seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. it makes me sad....",
    "i have a college education and a cpa to boot, but i need one lucky break in life.",
    "it is almost christmas, too.",
    "plus, i spend 50 dollars a day on lotto",
    "true, but the office was my home away from home. i need to figure out how to deal with my sadness.....",
    "well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times.",
    "i like to walk and do pushups on a regular __unk__ s; does that count??",
    "i don't think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. unemployment and government help until something else comes up.",
    "unemployment doesn't last forever; plus, i have pride in my work. americans are suppose to be strong.",
    "the happiness wears off, however.",
    "good bye.",
    "it does wear off, but if you get into a routine of doing it, it will help to alleviate some of that sadness",
    "ok thank you i hope things get going in the right direction for you.",
    "i am so mad that i can't see straight.",
    "hello! what is on your mind today?",
    "well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that i cant count them. i then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me.",
    "being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal. being mad when dumped is normal.",
    "i am wondering if i should beg him back?? i really do love him.",
    "i've been there too",
    "expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new",
    "yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. he asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings.",
    "if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak",
    "he told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? i think you're right.",
    "i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter",
    "trust me, its not worth it in the long run",
    "i think i have wasted a lot of my life and i can't ever get the time back that i have invested in him.",
    "i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid. once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again, i bet there will be a lot more breakups and a lot more options out there!",
    "yeah, i can see your point. it is nice being able to vent to you and feel like i am being heard. i never got that in my relationship with him. i need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it.",
    "i haven't even had the time to get myself cute and fixed up in forever! i love that idea! i need to get my haircut.",
    "no, i have idea?",
    "haha!! yes!! i was thinking the exact same thing! the best revenge is moving on and looking good and with somebody hot!",
    "sounds great! i am revived and am going to schedule a spa day and reinvent myself! out with the old! thank you for your encouragement today. i am going to move on from this mess and make my life better. thanks again!",
    "men can be such pigs!",
    "i met a handsome intelligent man.",
    "i am just trying to understand what i did wrong.",
    "to learn...",
    "hey, that is great advice!",
    "but when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly.",
    "can you share me some happy memories which made you smile",
    "sure, i love going to the movies! how about you!",
    "it's okay. i can understand.",
    "are you american?",
    "yes traveling is what we are made to do as humans!",
    "same",
    "like thanksgiving, i hope you have wonderful memories with your friends and family next week.",
    "you are very welcomed!",
    "well what are you having for lunch?",
    "hi",

    "i am not happy. i lost my job.",
    "oh, thats bad.",

    "hi there",
    "i am having such a hard time falling asleep at night... __unk__ i toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off",
    "yes that's right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. i am irritable and frustrated.",
    "i worry about my daughter, she has addictions. i never know if she is okay or not, she doesn't call me very often and is hard to get a hold of.",
    "have you any suggestions to help me get to sleep easier? i have tried meditation, but it doesn't seem to help much.",
    "sometimes i go to be early, sometimes late, maybe that is screwing me up",
    "good idea, i could try that",
    "ok well thankyou for your help",
    "are you a parent?",
    "thank you i __unk__ caite that, to you as well",
    "hello?",
    "stressed",

    "how do you handle things and stress?",
    "i guess",
    "i wish i had time lol",
    "__unk__ anything",
    "i am a multitasking queen, but even then i still dont have enough time it seems lol",
    "hello there. i'm suffering with increased depression and i'm not quite clear why.",
    "no not really. i have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. the only thing that is different these days is lockdown. i think that's the same for everyone.",
    "i saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. i've always had a low mood but now i'm anxious that it will continue to get worse.",
    "since lockdown haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. at the start it was fine, i was feeling just as i always have but i don't want this to get any worse. what if she isn't available?",
    "what like support groups etc? i'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. it's weird and a little concerning to be honest.",
    "i hadn't thought of that. i know there are a few of these nowadays.",
    "i'll start a plan and seeing if i can see my usual therapist and go from there. sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. do you have any experience with mental health issues?",
    "that must have been difficult to deal with. mental health affects so many people in so many ways. it's good that it's recognised these days at least.",
    "i think this is why it's always best to see a professional. i really should try to reconnect with mine.",
    "thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective.",
    "hi",
    "and i'm struggling with anxiety",
    "i know i'm going to badly because i haven't been learning well during the pandemic",
    "okay, i understand, i see how that can also make your anxiety worse.",
    "probably 4. my roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, i can't make any progress studying.",
    "i guess so. but if i fail or do badly on my exams it's really not going to be good. i'm on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3 __unk__ 0 gpa",
    "they're the biggest problem right now. but i think having to learn from home is the main problem. it's so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. no library, no office hours, no study groups.",
    "are you a student too?",
    "when the pandemic first started, we didn't have grades, and that was really helpful",
    "i feel like until way more people get the vaccine, we're still in the pandemic",
    "me too, unfortunately for us, universities don't seem t have the same sentiments.",
    "for starters, i think it would benefit you to eliminate the more closer problems: your roommates",
    "thanks for that suggestion. i have tried, but they are immature and just want to party. i've started staying in my room which helps, but is very isolating. i wish i could afford my own place",
    "makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. i can see your dilemma",
    "i face the situation of me being sad because i thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up",
    "yes, so we had a fight previously over thanksgiving break about how i woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. then i pick her up to go try and get breakfast.. __unk__ then she starts punching me while i drive so i pull over. then she keeps hitting me until i tell her to stop.",
    "it is because i do really miss her. i really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up",
    "yeah she was a little violent. i was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes.",
    "she was very open to talking and such but i just wasn't ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety",
    "i know but i am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. i still keep on thinking about her.",
    "i suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. don't be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too.",
    "it's way harder to do than say though. no, this is not my first breakup with a woman but i felt like she was the one for me",
    "maybe you're right! just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent",
    "i will definitely try. i know it will be hard because i am upset still but sometimes i guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation",
    "awww i hope so. just like some people say.. __unk__ there are plenty of fish in the sea. thank you for the advice. it was really helpful.",
    "hi, i'm feeling sad",
    "good afternoon to you",
    "yes, my best friend has decided that i'm not that important.. __unk__ or as important as i thought i was....",
    "she used to call me multiple times per day, it's been 3 days and nothing",
    "yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends",
    "absolutely.. __unk__ what do you think is wrong?",
    "i'm not sure, i don't think i have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven't had a fight",
    "maybe she is busy and the timing is off",
    "well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn't even want me to help her, no she doesn't work",
    "may not be a fight but she is busy settling in",
    "well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? she lives with her husband.",
    "a week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday",
    "hmm, no i didn't think about that, that may be a good idea",
    "yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, i didn't think there was that much to do, but maybe i should get a gift, to break the ice.",
    "yes, it is very important, i just felt if i called i would be bothering her : (",
    "that is possible, and it is a huge house, 4 stories",
    "no, we are not seeing each other in person due to covid. do you think i should try calling or texting first?",
    "yes, they certainly do, darn covid stops everything",
    "would a text be more appropriate vs. a phone call? what do you think?",
    "i just feel so hurt and abandoned, like i don't mean anything to her",
    "why not text her 1st to break the ice",
    "well, i think i will try that, i mean, it's not that intrusive. i hope she's not feeling alone, i hope she doesn't think i'm abandoning her!",
    "the virus is stopping people but we can find away",
    "yes, she has a son in college.",
    "i think i will text her and let her know i'm sending a gift card... __unk__ maybe she will respond.",
    "that's a great idea! thank you : )",
    "surprise her with the card 1st",
    "hi",
    "not feeling good. trying to find a job but no success",
    "i am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children.",
    "as a single mother it's pretty hard to go to search for food bank. i am spending most of my time in looking for a job.",
    "i don't know any as i never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable.",
    "one of my friends was really helpful. she moved to different city last month. after that i am totally shattered.",
    "life is becoming hard day by day. i am feeling guilty that i can't feed my kids well. no one wants to do friendship with poor people.",
    "thank you so much for all your support. you will be a great person for sure. i would like to be your friend but i have nothing to return.",
    "i would try to search near by food bank or ngos as you suggested. thank you so much for all you help.",
    "your words are motivational and it gave me positivity to move forward.",
    "could you please help?",
    "i am okay",
    "i caught my gf texting another guy",
    "yes right",
    "asking about what he was doing later. what he likes to do for fun",
    "yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed",
    "oh no! thats horrible too",
    "thanks so much! i think i can too. thanks for sharing with me",
    "no i feel like she should come to me about it since she was caught",
    "she didn't really say a whole lot, she just left right afterwards",
    "that's probably true, just a bit awkward",
    "it's not healthy",
    "relationships are tough",
    "thank you again!",
    "i'm sad",
    "my ex__unk__ boyfriend broke up with me",
    "because i didn't trust him and i was always jelous",
    "yes, i think so, because i should not feel like that, i should trust him",
    "i'm trying not to talk to him or think about him, because i feel better",
    "i spend a lot of time with him",
    "yes. i'll do it",
    "yes, i'm going to do that",
    "yes, it's true. for now, i'll just cry and sleep",
    "yes, thank you",
    "bye",
    "hello",
    "my life is done now",
    "well, i cannot say it is a new start when i will be 90 in march",
    "had",
    "he is 45",
    "i thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. he eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. he said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else.",
    "now i am here alone",
    "being single does not mean you're completely alone. there are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends.",
    "considering i haven't dated in 25 years.",
    "most of my old friends are no longer around...",
    "i am looking for something quicker, i don't know how much longer i have. i can't be spending months waiting for the right person.",
    "my great grandson said people meet others on tinder now. told me i should try it. have you heard of it or used it?",
    "possibly. my cats don't like to have a leash on them though",
    "why?",
    "i am going to try the park. there have been some cute gentlemen feeding the birds there. maybe they want to talk. thank you for the help.",
    "i could be better but thank you for asking",
    "i am upset about the loss of my best friend's son dying in a car accident",
    "he was only 26 years old",
    "i feel helpless because there is nothing i can do to make her feel better.",
    "it sounds like you're sticking close to your friend, although it doesn't feel like its helping.",
    "it's my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn't always an option.",
    "i really appreciate you taking the time to listen",
    "of course. these things are tough to face on your own, so you did the right thing by reaching out.",
    "enjoy the rest of your day and thank you again!",
    "the unemployment office is overwhelmed and i'm overwhelmed trying to help my family member.",
    "these days all of us have this situation. i can assure you that your family can understand it",
    "they have been going to temp services also.",
    "i also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus.",
    "the job center's can only help so much. and if they don't have internet skills __unk__ then online jobs will help.",
    "they are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it's hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess",
    "i wish this virus ends soon. but believe me everyone have similar situation these days",
    "no online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training.",
    "this sounds good. wish to learn soon",
    "i am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the covid.",
    "i'm so sorry. i feel a little better talking about this. my family tries to help other family members but we can only do so much. that's when i got frustrated __unk__ helping them with unemployment )",
    "thanks for listening and guidance.",
    "of course but having them by your side is a gift.",
    "yes and i wish you a good thanksgiving holiday.",
    "hi. i'm feeling okayish.",
    "absolutely. i recently broke up with my girlfriend. we had been together for more than 3 years.",
    "she said that she simply wasn't in love anymore, and that she didn't have the same feelings she did at the beginning.",
    "she was so important for me. i feel so empty.... i feel like i'm never finding anyone like her ever again,",
    "it's easier said than done. at times i would rather maybe just dissapear. i have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before.",
    "i am 25 at the moment.",
    "i disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. i don't think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. i was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman i meet.",
    "i think she wasn't feeling physically attracted to me anymore.",
    "but i surely think she wouldn't cheat on me.",
    "as if she didn't want me to see something",
    "i can't believe she would do something like that... i really need to confront her about it. i can't have this doubt on my chest.",
    "you are right. i need to take this slowly and calmly.",
    "hi how are you?",
    "doing ok, thanks.",
    "as far as holiday plans",
    "i completely understand that i feel that pain as well.",
    "oh i am sorry to hear that",
    "thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive",
    "cook a good meal and spend time with my kids and spouse. gifts wont be extravagant this year but i guess its the thought that counts",
    "totally, thanks for that insight",
    "i myself is going to enjoy good food and enjoy hopefully some decent winter weather",
    "very nice, does it snow where you live?",
    "no snow here the weather was really nice today high of 60 degrees",
    "which is not too bad either",
    "how was your thanksgiving? were you able to invite others or was it just with family? assuming you are in the us somewhere",
    "it's been a bad week for me",
    "the market has been tough",
    "but they are hard to come by now adays",
    "i've done many interviews",
    "thats good at least. well, its great you are being proactive about it!",
    "and make it to 2021",
    "so its been a bummer with covid going on",
    "thank you for your time",
    "before i go",
    "and not cost a lot of money",
    "good sunday",
    "i'm good. how r u?",
    "i'm not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends.",
    "nope. we are not on speaking terms. we have sued each other in court before. we are past talking.",
    "they're still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander",
    "no. i don't want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too",
    "absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don't allow to be disrespected by anyone",
    "i hear that! what happened in court when you went?",
    "i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn't strong enough.",
    "no. she hasn't done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her",
    "absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don't want to associate with them anymore?",
    "yeah exactly. people need to realize who's side to stay on",
    "it's easier said than done. a lot of people are afraid of being alone and will put up with garbage",
    "definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing!",
    "yeah it sucks lol",
    "i will. thank you for your advice",
    "thank ya! likewise",
    "hi, how are you doing? i am in bad mood.",
    "it makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation",
    "i understand. i, too, am struggling with covid__unk__ 19. it's going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. we'll get through this, though, don't you think.",
    "have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone?",
    "i dont find the time to spend with my partner and kids",
    "it could be better to have vacation for a week",
    "it sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you. you just need a better work__unk__ life balance to straighten things out.",
    "sounds good! i ll arrange a conversation with my head then",
    "then we have some quality time to spend together!",
    "yes, giving them a helping hand, getting things done together, could greatly improve your home life.",
    "yeah! thank you so much! it is good to have a conversation with you! now i am feeling better",
    "that's terrific to here. i'm happy you're feeling better.",
    "hah hah! it's ok, we can quit this conversation now! thanks once again!! __unk__ - )",
    "i am having ongoing depression.",
    "i'm very sorry to hear that. the fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder.",
    "i have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. it first began a couple of weeks ago.",
    "yes, i am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. i miss seeing my friends and family.",
    "yes, definitely. i hope the pandemic will end.",
    "i haven't thought about dying at all. i take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when i still feel sad.",
    "you're welcome. i understand, but i am not suicidal.",
    "i would like to talk about solutions since i feel like the problem is defined.",
    "yes, i enjoy taking walks and doing a cardio workout at home.",
    "i could communicate more with my family by calling them on the phone, texting, emailing, or talking to them on zoom.",
    "yes, i think that zoom and texting would make me feel less depressed.",
    "wanting to stay in bed is keeping me from using these methods.",
    "i feel okay about that.",
    "yes, it is worth a try. thank you for all of your help!",
    "thank you.",
    "i am having a really hard time with something that i did to my boyfriend.",
    "yes, thank you! i was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. i slipped up one night and hate to admit what i did.",
    "it sounds like you're holding onto a lot of guilt about this incident.",
    "yes, it is intense guilt. i can't think of anything else. i hate to tell you but i cheated on him. i am so sorry and can't look at myself in the mirror.",
    "that can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt.",
    "i feel like i am worthless and i don't deserve to ever be happy or laugh again. i really do love him and i don't ever want him to find out what i did. yes, i cant stop beating myself up. he doesn't know what i did but he is little suspicious.",
    "thank you! a long time ago his sister told me that he cheated on me and i believed her and so i wanted to get him back.",
    "it says a lot about your character that you feel badly about this, that you can see and recognize you acted in a way you don't agree with. that's something to build on.",
    "i appreciate that and have been thinking about character a lot lately. i do believe he cheated on me first, if that even matters now.",
    "yes, i feel very even! i won't do it again. can i ever give up the guilt that i feel and move on in our relationship or do i have to tell him what i did? i have known couples who don't tell each other and they are happy now.",
    "while it may be true in general that honesty is the best policy, in this case i wouldn't suggest telling him. it is just going to cause angry feelings.",
    "i am going to be in touch regularly of that's okay? i feel so much better now. i can take a deep breath again and i want to go take a walk with my dog now. thank you for all of your time and understanding.",
    "that sounds great because i want to keep this private and i know you won't tell anyone so i feel really safe here.",

    "i feel for your friend",
    "yes i have a therapist and currently on a 10 week post detox intensive plan to keep me focused. i have a good support network",
    "i just wish to live outside my own sideways mind for 5 minutes. i need help with not becoming frustrated and angry with myself. cant really see a way forward, am i destined to be absent minded for life? i know there must be a way somewhere to live normally",

    "it makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and i don't. i'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good i think, but sometimes i feel really really lonely too. like maybe i won't ever find anyone.",
    "thank you! exactly. but it is scary. i am guessing from your name that you identify as male __unk__ please forgive me if that is incorrect ), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women.",
    "haha, watering my own grass. that is a good way to put it. thank you for talking to me for a few minutes. it makes me feel a little bit better to have someone agree that it is okay to spend time working on me, instead of thinking that it is sad or pathetic or an excuse. i really appreciate it.",
    "have a good night, jonathan. __unk__ - )",
    "my friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and i am jealous",
    "great. i am good",

    "even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, i don't know and it just boggles on my mind.",
    "like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. if i can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. if they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then i don't think they should be doing that too much.",
    "and not compromise my values along with others",
    "yes i agree also. it's hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. i was more affected and more emotional. so i do see that i am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. so hopefully i can stay well mentally",
    "the relaxation technique, i mean",
    "yeah that's good advice. i will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news",
    "yeah i should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort.",
    "and i will keep those in my mind on a daily basis",

    "build up my confidence and not take things personally",
    "yeah, so true",
    "i have a few ideas and go with my strength's and abilities that i have already been successful in the past",
    "yeah, i like it. i guess i needed to just chat with someone and listen to myself.",
    "true, that is what my wonderful wife tells me and that god has a plan for me. thanks",
    "thank you. this has been helpful",
    "this is good. take care and god bless. ty",
    "you are welcome and best of wishes.",
    "you, too.",
    "i am feeling depressed",
    "i feel lost and lonely __unk__ i do not know what to do",
    "they came about when i lost my job in august of this year",
    "yes __unk__ finances have especially been very tight",
    "it is __unk__ have you ever encountered such a situation in your life?",
    "how did you snap out of the situation __unk__ did you have some savings?",
    "yes __unk__ i have been researching a lot too but it is difficult given that i have been surviving on the savings i had __unk__ also it is very difficult to get a loan currently.",
    "yes __unk__ i have two children __unk__ 5 and 9 year olds",
    "that is very helpful of you __unk__ i have been wandering all over the internet lost and not knowing where to find help from __unk__ i will definitely check this out and make good use of them __unk__ did you also get any funds from anyone?",
    "i agree that god is our ultimate guide and helper in all this __unk__ he will never forsake us no matter what __unk__ i will definitely turn to him at this time to seek for his guidance and with faith he will see me through.",
    "true __unk__ you have been very helpful and i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me",
    "hello i am very sad today. my partner is cheating on me.",
    "with another woman.",
    "how do you know that your partner is cheating on you?",
    "he will not admit it himself.",
    "i am sorry if your partner is cheating.",
    "so, your partner denies the charge of cheating?",
    "we are not married but we live together.",
    "2 years",
    "what do you mean exactly?",
    "i guess all people are different. i generally trust people easily.",
    "that is true. he is but, has been distant lately.",
    "do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?",
    "that is a good point.",
    "yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. slander in the work place happens.",
    "and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile",
    "i should trust my partner more than any random person.",
    "yes, the workplace is not like home life.",
    "but every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. how should i approach him to communicate better?",
    "okay! that is a good idea. maybe i can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together.",
    "find things that he has in common or energize the relationship.",
    "that is a good point. it is just hard to go on with the relationship when i feel i do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance.",
    "you have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign.",
    "we are 22.",
    "yes but less over the past few months.",
    "spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings.",
    "i mean, the love life. te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related... __unk__ for him.",
    "does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young.",
    "that's understandable. maybe i can communicate with him first.",
    "he is going to law school and i am going to med school. there is a ton of stress on both ends.",
    "i communicate much more than he does. thats why i think he is hiding something.",
    "you are right. i will try to be more sensitive about that. thank you for your help.",
    "do you think getting other people involved is a good idea?",
    "i would be subtle about that tactic.",
    "yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. we both live far away from home.",
    "yes off campus. same college.",
    "where do you work? have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating?",
    "seen the customer before? was it a man or woman who dropped the shocking news?",
    "it was a women. i know her, but not well. met a few times around school.",
    "hi there, i badly need someone to talk with!",
    "my partner left me after fifteen years and i simply do not know what to do.",
    "things had not been going well for a while but i had not realised just how bad it would be.",
    "about two weeks. i have barely left the house since then. i just do not feel that i can go on.",
    "i think mostly the latter. i just do not want to face the world any more. i feel that everyone must know that i've been dumped and be laughing at me.",
    "i did not really have any choice though. i do not see any future for myself now that we are separated.",
    "no i do not, who is that?",
    "thank you, i will. right now i really need some sort of emotional support. i feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste.",
    "i bring her up because what i sounds like is that you are feeling embarrassed because your partner made a choice that wasn't you",
    "it is not so much that - it is that i feel that i dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left.",
    "i really do not feel like it right now. what was the last fifteen years all about? i wanted to have children with him and he refused but now i hear he is expecting a baby with another woman.",
    "but it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and i do not know if i even want to.",
    "but i feel that i am facing middle age on my own and i really do not want to do that.",
    "what happens if i just can't ever get over it though? right now it's hard to see any sort of way through these feelings.",
    "i feel i might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because i waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that.",
    "most of my friends seem to be very happily coupled up right now. they are sympathetic but they do not really understand.",
    "that sounds like very good advice from both you and your doctor. it is a difficult thing to have to confront though. i really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to talk honestly with me.",
    "i hope that i will but am not sure. i really do feel rather better about things now though but - there's a long way to go. thank you so much for your support!",
    "my name is sean and i work for a large distribution company.",
    "hi! i'm sorry to hear that",
    "the pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting.",
    "no covid 19 has nothing to do with any of this work.",
    "i understand how anxious you are right now",
    "i'm a forklift operator..... i move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i",
    "doesn't feel like it to me.",
    "yes and they always say the same thing. you need to get your numbers up but it's a catch 22 you can't possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas",
    "so",
    "just a thought - did you try changing roles within the warehouse to a different position? or try checking with the manager regarding this",
    "i am a felon and i have a bachelores degree in business management. i am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas",
    "i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot",
    "my manager doesn't give a shit",
    "work at burger king for __unk__ 7 __unk__ 25 an hour",
    "do your best in your job!",
    "for a felon even with a degree that's phenominal in florida.",
    "america is just not fair.",
    "then paraguay",
    "i wish you all the best sean! i wish you good luck in all your future endeavors",
    "hello",
    "i am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from nyc.. my boyfriend and i have a home and my son does not like him.",
    "i am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling",
    "he is going back to school and i am supporting him in that. the problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. he gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me.",
    "he knows that i am torn. i am not going to put my son out of the house. i am also not one to get loud and angry. my son verbally is aggressive.",
    "yes, and i have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. he cannot take his frustrustations out on us.",
    "how long has this been going on?",
    "he came back last march for what we thought at the time would be a month or two.",
    "he is difficult to get through to. he seems to have traded midwestern charm for nyc bullying.",
    "i am not sure that he can afford that, but i have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. i want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy.",
    "that may work with a therapist. i have tried to __unk__ and both were terribly bull headed and argumentative.",
    "i am a quiet person and i want a happy household.",
    "thank you. you are right. i just want to get rid of the tension in the house.",
    "thank you. i want him to grow him quickly. he is 25 and is doing okay. no need to be angry.",
    "thank you. have a good evening.",
    "not doing well. i cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else.",
    "we were together for 2 years. it was such a surprise when she sprung this on me.",
    "i feel lost. i'm so used to her being around everyday. now i don't know what to do with myself without her.",
    "i understand, i was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word.",
    "not only that, but with covid going on i have noone i can see to talk about it.",
    "yes, i do, but they are far away.",
    "friends closeby?",
    "hobbies?",
    "i don't have any true hobbies. i don't think they will fill the void anyways.",
    "i've had time to myself but its not getting any better.",
    "what positive are there here?",
    "i'm actually trying to get into the software development field, how do you like it?",
    "it's ok. pays the bills. but my job is pretty independent. so i don't even get to meet new people. i am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day.",
    "what, you want to break stuff to relieve stress",
    "i completely understand. my wife used to think i was just playing on the computer all day, lol.",
    "i run",
    "that sound like something i could give a try. any other seggestions?",
    "well, i'm going try going for a run right now. thanks for the suggestion. i'll see if that helps.",
    "i do know how a programming job can take away from some social aspects of your life, maybe try and go to a bar, or somewhere social to get out some.",
    "no problem, i hope i have helped you some.",
    "appreciate the talk, and suggestions. i'll give it a try. have a great night.",
    "i am having problems because i need money and the only jobs i can find are outside of the hours i need to work and i'm having anxiety",
    "oh, that is anxiety__unk__ provoking...",
    "well*",
    "it's great that you are putting out applications elsewhere as well!",
    "i am walking",
    "oh i understand",
    "maybe i could call an uber home",
    "i think the stress outside of the job is also contributing",
    "also just safety issues",
    "what do you do for safety?",
    "two months but we've known each other way longer than that",
    "i think the uber is a good idea. i don't have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it.",
    "that's good to consider! i think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about ubering home",
    "yeah we went to middle school together",
    "oh it's okay my bad!",
    "yes",
    "well mostly he'shaving problems affording rent too and i can't help him much and it sucks that i can't help him ata ll",
    "yes",
    "it makes me feel sad and lost. i'm afraid he's going to lose his apartment",
    "no it doesn't",
    "i helped him financially a lot but i'm at my end too now",
    "yes",
    "no, not really i mean if i had more i would give him everything i could that wouldn't leave me financially behind",
    "no i wouldn't. i want it to help support me.",
    "yeah, i just want to be able to have my own stuff again. i've been relying on doing surveys online.",
    "yes",
    "also being far away from him sucks",
    "we aren't facetiming. i just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it.",
    "i'm trying my best, thank you for the input!",
    "upset about leaving the apartment?",
    "just leaving him",
    "i asked and that's what he told me",
    "same",
    "that is very cute",
    "he isn't really the romantic type",
    "yes",
    "probably just being at home",
    "things are hard right now though",
    "i am one of the only people he has in his corner right now",
    "oh i'm sorry to hear that... it must be difficult for you to be in this position, i understand the stress and pressure",
    "he was let go cause of covid",
    "i'm sorry to hear that",
    "yes he's trying unemployment",
    "unemployment helps you find jobs and pays you while you do it here",
    "hi, i feel really sad.",
    "my friends won't hang out with me. i am alone all the time.",
    "yes, but also just no one to hang out with. i am a loner.",
    "no. i want to hang out with people.",
    "i like to talk with them, listen to their stories, just hang out have a good time.",
    "what do you do to feel better?",
    "thank you for the suggestions! i appreciate it.",
    "thank you! i feel better!",
    "good bye.",
    "not too well. i have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed.",
    "sorry to hear that. i absolutely understand, it's been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people.",
    "i think things will improve, but not for a year or more.",
    "i agree. i lost a teacher some time ago and i've been thinking a lot about when things might improve. a year seems plausible.",
    "a year is a long time when you are 76 years old. i just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can't enjoy it any longer.",
    "sorry to hear that. it is really tough being restricted to not travelling.",
    "thank you so much for your support. it is tough and there is nothing to do.",
    "do you have family you can talk to?",
    "yes, i do, but i can't talk to my son in florida because he lost his job and havng tough time. i don't feel like i should enjoy my life when he is suffering. we may need to help him financially. i use to volunteer at a nursing home, but i am afraid to now with the virus",
    "that is reasonable. and it sounds like you are doing all you can.",
    "i am trying to do what i can for my son and also to help so i don't get too down and depressed.",
    "you are doing everything you can. some things are just beyond our control.",
    "thank you - that makes me feel some better. you are right and i learned more than ever that some things i con't control. yes, we are all struggling and trying to get this this pandemic. i am sorry that we are all going through this and pray it will get over soon.",
    "yes, we will get through this - it helps so much to have others support. i do thank you very much for talking with me today. have a great day!",
    "hello",
    "somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. how about you?",
    "i'm developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn't share those feelings with me in return.",
    "that is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. i have been there myself.",
    "yes, i had received that advice from someone and tried it but it didn't help. we have been friends for a long time and i think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings.",
    "i'm also pretty sure she's already aware. she's pretty sharp.",
    "that sounds like a good plan. i do like having things out in the open instead of holding them in. my other thought was to maybe try to seek out a romantic partner that isn't her so then maybe the feelings would go to another focus and it wouldn't damage our relatinship.",
    "that sounds like a great idea.",
    "no, it has been difficult with the whole corona virus thing. i have taken a large income hit and also i'm having trouble finding someone who wants to actually go do something.",
    "i think i'll give that a try. i could use a new hobby anyways.",
    "i feel a lot better nwo that i have some options.",
    "yes, thank you. and you also have a great day.",
    "hi",
    "did not lose a single pound.",
    "wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight.",
    "so now on fasting.",
    "i also go to gym 2 times a week.",
    "yea, very discouraged...",
    "losing weight can be difficult. i've struggled with that many times.",
    "i considered but they said i am not overweight.",
    "it seems like they didn't listen to your needs.",
    "and it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight.",
    "causing a lot of pain as well for my lower back",
    "that's no good. i'll bet that is difficult to deal with.",
    "no, i have to look after the kids.",
    "well, you could also take the kids on a walk every day.",
    "thanks for your suggestion though.",
    "that's great! now you can all go swimming together.",
    "yes, i am doing that.",
    "nice speaking to you though, you have been very kind.",
    "thanks for your encouragement!",
    "i'm feeling really sad, i thought it was going somewhere",
    "i'm sorry to hear that. what do you mean you thought it was going somewhere?",
    "yes i'm okay, i'm so sad. five years, i gave my heart to this girl",
    "yes she broke my heart last night, what did i do wrong?",
    "but i gave her my all. i feel so betrayed. i'm feeling so sad i want to jump over a bridge",
    "you think it's my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart",
    "don't give up, you never know what the future holds.",
    "thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me?",
    "well i don't know. why end so abruptly",
    "she just said it's over! over the damn phone",
    "not at all, so heart broken",
    "have you tried talking to her since?",
    "no, she won't pick up her phone",
    "not good. i was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. i am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic.",
    "but i tried negotiating. they are down__unk__ sizing the entire sales department. what else can i do?",
    "hmmm, i can see that this is stressful for you",
    "yes i am preparing my resume but job vacancies are few and far between. i am worried about my next job.",
    "okay then, it's good that you already started",
    "ok. do you have any ideas for sales positions?",
    "i will. how can i get help from friends? only very few are in sales field.",
    "and remember, what are we if we stop fighting?",
    "i agree. i should never give up. but due to financial commitments, i am somewhat afraid of failing.",
    "life is full of surprises, but we should get advantage of bad situations",
    "you are right! hard work will pay. i need to pull my socks up...",
    "sure, after all i am known to be a fighter!",
    "yeah that's the spirit",
    "i truly appreciate your motivational words.",
    "don't let the stress and fear overcome you, get control and who knows maybe you get a better job",
    "at least for now",
    "yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me.",
    "he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt",
    "there is nobody i can talk to about this, i dont really have friends and my siblings are busy with their lives",
    "sure, thanks for this",
    "yoga sounds interesting but i will try starting it by weekend. some calming music will do at the moment. any suggestions for me?",
    "thanks so much for this, i feel a weight lifted off my mind",
    "thank you for calming words",
    "sure, you too",
    "i am very worried about losing my job",
    "anxious. i think my boss wants to fire me.",
    "i am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. i have been in your shoes before.",
    "how can i explain that i may be late to the office, but that i am a valuable employee?",
    "have you explained to him your reasoning? i also once had to take care of my sick grandmother after work and had a tough time explaining it to my boss.",
    "no. but that is a good idea.",
    "it's a very competitive office and i don't want to look weak.",
    "i do. i hope i can explain the situation clearly and offer to make up time by staying late.",
    "i will reach out to hr.",
    "thank you. you have been very helpful and uplifting.",
    "also review your employee handbook and see if there are things you can do to negotiate with hr or your boss in regards to your hours.",
    "my anxiety is disappearing with the suggestions you have offered.",
    "i have only been here for 6 months. i think being new is contributing to the anxiety i am feeling.",
    "i understand. being new at a job can have its difficulties.",
    "thank you for your encouragement.",
    "i hope your boss can understand you are facing a difficult time. if he has loved ones or family of his own, he surely will.",
    "hi, how's your day going?",
    "hello. im doing good. how are you doing?",
    "not so good unfortunately.",
    "due to this pandemic, i am fearful for my job security and future in general.",
    "there is currently a lock down in my area. it seems like things are getting worse. my anxiety is high.",
    "i doubt it will get better, but thanks for the positive vibes.",
    "any suggestion on activities to help me past time?",
    "that is great to hear. i wish i had someone i can talk to. now i feel even more depressed.",
    "what kind of book genres do you recommend?",
    "any suggestion on tv shows?",
    "i'm just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands.",
    "thank you. i think since the pandemic it's gotten worse. it's hard to find the __unk__ reason\" to go about my day.",
    "what about you?",
    "i try to keep a routine with exercise and cooking, things like that. going outside for walks...",
    "oh that's great!",
    "that's true. very good points. it's hard to find a purpose right now because i'm unable to find work. when i started going to school i certainly wasn't expecting any of this to be happening __unk__ obviously ). i waited until my 30s to go to college so i feel angry that all of this is happening.",
    "i understand being angry about that. going to school supposedly is__unk__ was a way to take control of one's life, it's no longer the guarantee is once was.",
    "i sometimes feel a similar way about my own classes. i am also in my thirties.",
    "but i personally enjoy learning, and would always regret it if i never finished my degree. we all have our cultural norms that we conform to, whether consciously or unconsciously.",
    "do you find yourself being stymied at the application level or the interview level when it comes to jobs?",
    "i feel sad, and feel like need help",
    "and since then im feeling really sad",
    "is there something i can do to feel better?",
    "no, i live alone, my family lives in another state",
    "i talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine",
    "yes",
    "can you recommend someting for me to do to feel better?",
    "thank you",
    "makes me feel better to chat a bit with you, helped me to relax",
    "and try to chat a bit more at leaat with my family",
    "im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy",
    "yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me",
    "very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn't see me cuz he was busy. now he's asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me",
    "confused! i'll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn't like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them",
    "cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell",
    "yes but i'm afraid what i'll hear",
    "it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i'll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face",
    "possibly. i'd prob be better being away from the situation",
    "i feel there are benefits to it also",
    "it gives me an upper edge and more clout",
    "being on the board gives me perks",
    "yes and i think he is using me to a degree also",
    "yes",
    "what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me",
    "i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment.",
    "if you were me you would forget about him and the board",
    "okay. i'll try to lay low and walk away from it",
    "yes but it's less than before cuz of covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this- if that makes sense",
    "yes",
    "i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too",
    "i can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be",
    "his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it",
    "you can tell this is a very twisted situation",
    "not really. i just felt that if he stayed with me i wouldn't have slept with his friend and almost did with his other one",
    "thank ya for listening. i think it'll clarify itself in time",
    "hello, can you help me?",
    "hello. i hope so",
    "i am really struggling with my studies at the moment, i am so anxious that i keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time.",
    "yes, i am a mature student and struggling with my course.",
    "i can understand how you feel. i was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school.",
    "yes, the pandemic is making it worse. i am working as well so i am struggling juggling them all and running a house. i just don't know how to get back on track with my studying",
    "how would i go about that?",
    "if you go online, there are different templates for students. one would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day.",
    "i do have a couple that i could contact, i've been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think i am being silly",
    "i could colour coordinate it, i like things in colour",
    "ok, do you think i should reach out to my classmates, will they think i'm being silly, i really don't want to alienate them",

    "i have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. i have lost interest in everything i can barely make myself go to work.",
    "maybe, why would he cheat? i have seen her she is not that pretty. i thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination.",
    "i thought i was a good girlfriend, i was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. i must just be unlovable.",
    "i trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. i thought we were so perfect together, i don't want him back i could never trust him again, i am not sure i could trust any guy right now, i am so hurt and confused. i don't ever want to feel like this again.",
    "this was the first guy i ever lived with, i thought we would get married one day. how do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts.",
    "i have a couple acquaintances at work but i wouldn't want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but i almost couldn't stop once i started. he was my best friend and who i talked to once we got together i didn't seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. that is why i am here for support.",
    "have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? does the aching inside ever get better? how long will it take?",
    "i am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. you have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. i do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. he said if i ever needed someone to talk to he was there. i thought he was just being nice. maybe i should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere.",
    "thank you for checking on that for me, i hope it is quicker i would hate to feel this way that long. i think i will go see him he is home right now. you have made me feel hopeful and that there will be an end to these feelings and maybe things will go as well for me as they did you. thank you again.",

    "they told she's bad news",
    "i understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today.",
    "yes, i tried but it won't get through their head. there are so old school. they want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap?",
    "the basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys.",
    "they told me she's gold digger. yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one.",
    "nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill.",

    "how are you going to help me study? i am not sure if you are familiar with my course material...",
    "my exam is about contract law. i have the whole night, but i have studied all day and am exhausted.",
    "wow, that's actually a really good idea. i have a friend who took the course last year but i am worried that if i ask her for help she will think poorly of me.",

    "i feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. i feel other people are ashamed of me.",
    "i just can't live reguarly life like __unk__ healthy\" people do and they notice my symptoms. they don't understand how your mind can be your enemy.",
    "like i have no interest or motivation to do anything some days. hard to even take care of my hygiene. my mind doesn't care to do it even when it's embarrasing for people to notice.",
    "that sounds very hard. i can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn't want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself.",

    "i think that's all. i feel better now. i'll try more.",
    "i think a friend i've known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. even during the pandemic she has made new friends.",
    "oh, i'm sorry, that's not fun at all, especially since you two have been friends for so long.",
    "she likes watching tv show and told me with her new friend they facetime and watch tv together. i really hate watching tv so don't want to offer to participate.",
    "well, it's a positive sign that she hasn't blocked you completely. i agree, texting her each day could irritate her.",
    "i am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. i have not made a new friend in over 10 years.",
    "i don't have many other friends and they are out of state. the one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year,",
    "so you're saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic, correct?",
    "hurt, mad, jealous. i have trouble getting out enough to make friends - even if there wasn't a pandemic. i work a lot.",
    "good to know i'm not alone.",
    "work place is very small and i'm not in the clique there. vaccine will be available to my age group soon and the weather is getting warmer. so there is that to look forward too.",
    "good idea. i really hope being able to take walks will help me clear my thoughts.",
    "i may join the book club when the library reopens.",
    "good ideas. thank you. it was nice chatting with you.",
    "what should i do",
    "i try to find a job but there is not many",
    "about 6 months",
    "i understand that there are a lot of job loss in the covid time. is your job seeking related to that?",
    "yes",
    "i was applying for jobs for almost a year, and i got an offer in february right before coronavirus. i can definitely relate to you.",
    "yeah, but it is still rough to get by",
    "technical skill in trade school but not degree from college",
    "i will seek for another jobs if possible but i can work on manufacturer company too",
    "if i can work remotely i will do it.",
    "i tried but there are no responds after my interview",
    "thanks, i will try more on the website you suggest",
    "do they charge you when you get a job?",
    "i hope i can be more helpful. i really __unk__ thize with your situation.",
    "thank you, there are no many availability of what i can do and it is just out of control from nowhere",
    "thank you for your kindness",
    "what kind of jobs open right now.",

    "no, not this time until school open.",
    "okay, in the mean time follow my advice. it will help.",
    "i am so stressed.",
    "i am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along.",
    "oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part!",
    "my colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly.",
    "i don't have a second screen, but i do have a large tv. i may be able to hook it up via hdmi.",
    "the mute thing is horrible. i have no ideas for that. hahah. i'm looking for help with that too!",
    "it is worse when using in ears, because it's like all i can hear is my heartbeat.",
    "that sounds like a great idea. have you had any weird technological solutions to help you through distance learning?",
    "it seems almost like a thin tablet that you plug in to your laptop. i like the idea.",
    "do you live in an apartment or home?",
    "okay how are you?",
    "just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who i do not like that way would be considered microcheating",
    "it is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don't act on because you are married.",
    "yes i see that. no nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn't be as exact for the type of person that i do not talk to because of his reservations about it.",
    "comfort my fiance",
    "to never speak to your fiance?",
    "no i am ending my friendship with him. that is what is best.",
    "yes very.",
    "yes, i think that would be best. i thank you for your time.",
    "it is okay see talking about this is actually microcheating. so now i am worried about that.",
    "that is why i brought it up.",
    "yes i don't have any friend that arent men so i think therapy is going to help. i don't talk to anyone anymore. but i thank you for your time. i just wanted to clarify why i brought it up. i hope you have a good day.",
    "good evening",
    "things are ok i am just having issues with the problem above",
    "i don't know why it happens and it worries me",
    "i can understand that - when i was sitting my final exams i constantly had nightmares about failing. nearly thirty years on and i still do!!",
    "me*",
    "yes you are correct",
    "have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? a therapist perhaps?",
    "where do you recommend going?",
    "does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? many do.",
    "oh? charities?",
    "i have never heard of such people, i am interested",
    "really though i think that your problem is self esteem.. you should think better of yourself : )",
    "i think you're right, but i don't know, i'm still scared about having the bad dreams. i often wake up 2__unk__ 3 times at night because of them.",
    "i can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life. have you tried to take anything to help?",
    "i can recommend a hot milky drink before bed and perhaps a hot water bottle. anyway i hope that i have been able to be of some assistance to you!",
    "merry christmas to you",
    "i could be better. how about u?",
    "a friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. i am no longer friends with her. we were really close before this.",
    "oh no! i am so sorry that has happened to you. that must feel like such a betrayal.",
    "i invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. she took the money and ran.",
    "what do you suggest?",
    "hello?",
    "a cat cafe. where you can hang out and work or drink with adoptable cats from the local shelter.",
    "i gave her 80k. no messages. it was all done in person. do you think i should get a lawyer and call the cops?",
    "it is. i don't want to go to the police. i think they are all corrupt and raciest.",
    "that's great advice. i will do that. i have a mutual friend that is a lawyer.",
    "hi",
    "trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once : (",
    "its so stupid. i keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. the thoughts just come so fast",
    "tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes i cant controll the thoughts or like i dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing",
    "i have one and it helps sometimes. i try to meditate",
    "i pretty much have to do it constantly",
    "yeah maybe its as simple as that. i know im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part",
    "right. i will try and start that more today and commit to it",
    "yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized",
    "yes. do you meditate? '",
    "do you want to keep talking or should we wrap up? i could go either way",
    "yes",
    "it was great chatting : )",
    "my friend borrowed money from me but she won't return it now",
    "yes __unk__ i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely.",
    "i understand. i have been through a similar situation.",
    "yes __unk__ it was for me __unk__ a total of __unk__ 10000",
    "oh, that is a very large amount of money. i can understand your being upset with them",
    "yes __unk__ she just sounded non__unk__ comittal __unk__ saying that she will return it when she can",
    "yes __unk__ i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer",
    "were you speaking on the phone or in person? is this a financial burden for you?",
    "yes __unk__ it is a financial burden because this is money i was saving for a venture",
    "it is difficult to judge on the phone yes __unk__ which is why i wanted a physical meeting but she snapped at me and said that she will just pay me when she can",
    "yes __unk__ very difficult",
    "how do you suggest i shoulp proceed?",
    "and you chose what?",
    "thank you very much for the advice",
    "hi",
    "hello",
    "how are you?",
    "wanted to ask for some mental support",
    "not being able to find a job after graduation",
    "okay",
    "yes i did, and quite a lot but i think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much",
    "yes",
    "maybe my cv is just bad",
    "yes they do i am familiar with that",
    "i think i could improve it",
    "i've asked some friends, i think a friend will help me out when he's not busy",
    "yes i know",
    "it's hard with this virus to go anywhere pretty much",
    "haven't even got the graduation ceremony lol",
    "all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon",
    "yea that's what i am thinking of doing",
    "thank you",
    "you made my mood go up",
    "have a great evening and thanks for suggestions : )",
    "hello",
    "it's been tough. i've been looking for a job for months, but feel like i'm getting nowhere.",
    "well, i am fortunate to have a job, but i am seeking a different job because the one i have does not pay what my skills are worth. it barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills.",
    "ok, that is a bit of relief",
    "i have, but there are few decent jobs out there. most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk.",
    "i would have to relocate 4 hours away, but i would do it in a heartbeat for this job.",
    "working there would be ministry, not typical work. and because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships.",
    "thank you. i believe there are three things in my favor: i know the job well, as i became friends with the person i would be replacing, my pastor wrote a glowing reference, and i was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current __unk__ related ) job fifteen years ago.",
    "we worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer__unk__ work partner? i know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. i know half the core staff i would be working with daily and think of them as extended family.",
    "and though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team.",
    "at the risk of preaching religion, i believe god may be calling me to serve there.",
    "that is definitely a dream job. god is everywhere",
    "when off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests. there is an olympic sized pool, field games, a gymnasium, an exercise room, and if off duty, one can attend most any of the events on the campus, unless designated as a private event.",
    "because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that i get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes. it would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along.",
    "the music events year round are outstanding. they have many well known names in christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing. to be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless.",
    "and we're across the street from mountains and a river. the campus is simply beautiful.",
    "fifteen years of directly related experience, with about another 15 to 20 years of customer service, call center, and customer facing work.",
    "i hope and pray everything happens the way you wished. you have been working hard.",
    "thank you",
    "hello __unk__ is anone there?",
    "i don't know. i'm shaking because i don't know what i'm going to do.",
    "i know you're probably prepping for the holiday. i didn't mean to interrupt your sunday.",
    "im sorry but we do not get those promps",
    "have you ever been evicted?",
    "where are you that you are able to be evicted?",
    "i'm still in my condo but i no longer have a job, umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone.",
    "also, i'm calling a helpline so pride is not my issue.",
    "i have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. i am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. i was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures",
    "i don't mean to be crass either but i have never been jobless or homeless either. so i'm desperate here and don't know what to do?",
    "where did you wash up or brush your teeth?",
    "oh for my situation it was 100% my fault i was in a bad place during that time. i spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me. bounced around shelters after i sold my car. washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems.",
    "i rather not say. but thank you for you for sharing and i hope you and your family have a good thanksgiving.",
    "i was going to paste a link for you on evictions during covid. please just google evictions during covid __unk__ your state ) you will find groups that can help and the laws, that are on your side.",
    "hello, i need some help with this.",
    "what should i do about my break up?",
    "when it was happened",
    "it happened yesterday. she broke up with me.",
    "i will try but i don't think she will want to listen. i do not think she likes me anymore.",
    "i think i will call her later, i will try to follow your advice. what should i do to help my bad emotions?",
    "i feel bad about the whole covid thing. i think there is a lot of stress about it with my ex girlfriend so she feels stressed about that.",
    "hello?",
    "doing alright, thanks. yourself?",
    "good to hear.",
    "i've been feeling very down lately.",
    "sure. i feel depressed about the state of the us and of the rest of the world. it's very overwhelming.",
    "yes and a lot of uncetainty.",
    "most definitely, i've also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what's going on.",
    "it's good to know others feel the way i do. i've been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much.",
    "yes with lots of conflicting information.",
    "work, read, exercise. i've been going to the gym more.",
    "thank you. i'm trying. i really don't want to be on medication.",
    "i am trying. i don't want to fall deep down an emotional black hole.",
    "understandable",
    "yes, my husband is very supportive but i don't want to upset him too much so i don't fully open up.",
    "i will look into the telehealth. thank you for that recommendation.",
    "i will give that a try. thank you again.",
    "an doing better but things at work place gets me real down",
    "i think boss hate me",
    "all he does is complain",
    "i think its directed to me",
    "if am asked to complete a task, i do complete them and make sure no mistake was made, if he will evaluate the task he always sees fault in what i do",
    "i think i'll quit the job",
    "maybe talk to his secretary and make an appointment with him.",
    "i think that's a good idea",
    "i try doing just that, i hope it works",
    "thanks so much",
    "hello, how are you?",
    "well, i'm really upset with my friends.",
    "yes, they aren't taking covid seriously.",
    "yes but they get angry with me. i don't know how to get through to them,",
    "it's a weird dynamic.",
    "that's exactly right.",
    "i'd like to think so but i wish they would too. it's hard to know what is right.",
    "yes, but they'll have their bbqs and parties anyway. they are having a group thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. my husband and i feel bad that we aren't going, but we also know it isn't smart.",
    "and i agree. the longer we put it off and don't take it seriously, the longer it will last.",
    "can you tell them that that just isn't the case? you and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. if i am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don't want to see your pals and family!",
    "they just think living for the moment is the bigger picture.",
    "i think they do. they just think that this is a hoax.",
    "yeah i don't think they get it.",
    "thank you. i hope it gets better. but anyway thank you for giving me the chance to open up.",
    "hi",
    "hi. how's it goin '?",
    "are you feeling troubled about something this morning?",
    "my father understands the situation that my earning is not that much, but my mum will fuck complain that i am taking care of my wife but not her",
    "it sounds like you're having some cash flow issues, right? i can relate to that at a few more points in my life than i'd points in my life than i'd like to recall.",
    "it's so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift!",
    "that isn't all that common anymore, unfortunately..",
    "yes, i am working but the income is not that much",
    "that is the major concern, the gift is once in a year and now all my bills are needed to be paid at least before end of the week",
    "i will need to be happy and get rid of this fucking depression, i can't kill my fucking self.",
    "i'm doing okay.",
    "i'm having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. i feel bad because these are things that other people do normally",
    "exactly. jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed",
    "yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. i've been doing mturk here and there. i plan on doing it more. it helps me stay productive.",
    "okay, i hear you. thanks. yeah, i guess i have to really force myself.",
    "force yourself at first, then the __unk__ body in motion, stays in motion\" law will take over. : )",
    "okay okay. cool. that's a helpful concept. i'm going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. yes, that's true. i hate ending the day knowing i've bummed it out",
    "yes, i agree. i used to go to at least one concert every year. now that's out of the question. it gets boring and a little depressing. hopefully 2021 will be better.",
    "i will definitely. i just got to get up and get with it. i'm really in need of some exercise so i'll do that too. i used to paint and draw but i kind of fell off and stopped doing it. i'll get back into that too.",
    "i agree fully and i'm happy for you. i think i've been in some sort of depression for some time now. i stopped doing everything i loved. i used to love jogging but i stopped doing that too. i ended up gaining a lot of weight and now i don't like going anywhere or being seen at all. i'm usually 130 and i've shot up to 200. so i think if i can just get my routine down and exercise, i'll be alright.",
    "hi there",
    "i'm surviving. today is better than yesterday was.",
    "that's good.",
    "i've been out of work since covid closed down the live event industry in march. the unemployment system still hasn't processed any of my claims, and i have been surviving off of what i can make driving for doordash, which hasn't been a lot.",
    "i wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs i've applied for would hire me to do something form home",
    "i completely understand. i also wish mturk paid more, i feel like it takes a lot of time for not that much money.",
    "no, i live with housemates but they all don't drive.",
    "i understand.",
    "are you still there?",
    "yes i am still here.",
    "before this my work was primarily in concert audio, with a side hustle of carpentry. i've been playing with these survey sites, and applying for a lot of call center jobs that don't seem interested in me. if you have any suggestions i'm open to them!",
    "if you worked in audio i know that some places, like upwork and acx __unk__ which does some audiobook work ) are looking for audio editing. i am sure that other places are looking for audio editing. i think fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work.",
    "okay, well thanks for chatting with me and helping me earn the bonus for this task!",
    "hello, how are you doing today?",
    "i am glad you are doing well, i have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that i was going to propose to broke up with me. she told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out.",
    "how was your career path different?",
    "she had a desire to do marine biology and i wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. she would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. she was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist.",
    "i am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. she now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. i found out that he works with her at the nursing home. i am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn't see how our career paths would work out and that was that.",
    "if anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right",
    "i have had some friends echo that. i agree, it definitely felt like i was giving a lot through the time we dated. i have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her i think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. the new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that i think has caused me to question her parting words",
    "right but to be honest i would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don't support your career",
    "i appreciate your feedback on this, __unk__ this event for context occurred about a year ago and i have moved on from it ) my support system has said the same thing. i think the difficult part is just overcoming that mental__unk__ emotional hurdle of having the desire to marry her, which failed since it was an expectation of what was to come. i appreciate your suggestions. i think being the best __unk__ me\" will help equip me for my future spouse! : )",
    "what did you do to help overcome the depression you faced or the grief of what was?",
    "that is a valid point, i appreciate your help with this situation and listening to what i experienced.",

    "that sounds amazing, i should give it a try : )",
    "please do! you can try it with friends or alone. with friends can be a more fun experience while alone can be more spiritual or calming",

    "i haven't but maybe that will help me stay calmer.",
    "that makes sense.",
    "i haven't but that may be helpful as well.",
    "that might help me to take the stress off myself and get someone to help in the search.",
    "yes, i'm starting to feel some of the pressure taken off me.",
    "i feel a lot better. thanks for your support.",
    "my boyfriend broke up with me.",

    "should i call him?",
    "and they took his side!",
    "how did you get through it?",

    "i think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. i hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will.",
    "and i cannot afford therapy.",
    "i think you really need to take it one day at a time. things are very raw for you right now",
    "i don't know if i could do that. i don't like talking about my problems with strangers.",
    "and yet here we are __unk__ p. therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, i have found.",
    "do you have any suggestions about how to open up to people i don't know?",
    "that's what i am afraid of. being judged by people.",
    "probably. he called me a lot of names.",
    "i'm good at bowling. and i like riding horses.",

    "thanks! have a good day.",
    "i need some help. i have been depressed.",

    "i've tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones.",
    "yeah, i'm kinda old for that - lol!!! my back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn't be comparable.",
    "well i hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me.",
    "yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed.",
    "i think i might be able to call my friend, but she's in another state",
    "that would not be enough money. i would not be able to pay my bills.",
    "that's true but i don't want to lose my house either",
    "she may be able to help - she could at least send me in the right direction of where to look and maybe how to freshen up my resume.",
    "that is true - i just hate to bother her, she's got so much on her plate already.",
    "hello.",
    "hi there",

    "it is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming.",
    "do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though?",
    "yes it's all virtual though",
    "that is a good idea. do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things?",
    "i see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college?",
    "okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down?",
    "okay but is it normal to be upset?",
    "okay that makes me feel better",
    "i am glad it does __unk__ d!",
    "that's it! thank you for your help",
    "and i have a few assignments and two exams coming up __unk__ all to be done at the end of this and the next month )",

    "i see. i am kind of doing that but i do get sidetracked from time to time. i get distracted by my computer and the tv, etc. it's on and off like that. i agree with you that i find that the method of following a schedule and __unk__ en is useful to me.",
    "thank you for your trust in me.",

    "of course! i find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.",
    "timer, great idea.",
    "thank you for sharing these.",
    "not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious.",
    "and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, i am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation.",
    "yes, it's true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood.",
    "so yes, the second wave is here it seems __unk__ belatedly ), but hopefully it doesn't get worse, because i have seen worse in other places right now",
    "ok. i could look into that. i work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year.",
    "yes and i have been and will continue to do that.",
    "but aside from these stressors, i think i have a better idea now on how i should proceed, starting today",

    "alright then. i will continue my day from here then. thanks again, and good luck with your endeavours!",

    "it's been going on for months with no end in sight",
    "yes, some video chats, but not the same",
    "well, i make sure i continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues i have available. it is definitely not the same, but it's what we have at the moment.",
    "she sanitizes the house even though no one comes in it. bitches at me.",
    "is this going to end soon???",
    "i do value her, just not the paranoia.",
    "hello",
    "i have been better. i had a rough semester in school.",
    "it was alright at first but i failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade",
    "yes, i already tried to appeal my grade.",
    "sadly, no. i think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me",
    "it was a core class and i needed it to graduate",
    "that does sound like a good idea. i am just so disappointed i'm not sure if it is worth it.",
    "i think you're right. the class is tough and i know i can do it if i put my mind to it.",
    "it is very intimidating but again i agree with you. thanks for your input",

    "i've spoken to my boss. he was sympathetic about it all... __unk__ at this point i'm not sure what to do.",
    "any other suggestions?",
    "we are going through some really tough times right now and i think that most people are very sympathetic. especially for those who are in your shoes. our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. how do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little?",
    "i do get paid vacation",
    "another suggestion that i have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. i know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you're keeping safe!",
    "hello i am in need of assistance.",
    "i am tom. how can i help you?",

    "thank you for that",
    "the library is within the campus",
    "you did? how was the experience?",

    "anything to help support my family and my academics during these trying times",
    "haha i'll maybe focus on the job at hand first tom",
    "thank you for listening to my situation and giving me advice tom",
    "i feel that the local libraries are great options for working and learning. i met my future wife while working at the library many moons ago.",
    "i am feeling really sad and lonely right now. my boyfriend and i broke up and it was me who wanted it but now i regret breaking up and he doesn't want me back.",
    "that is exactly it. i broke up with him because i liked another person but then quickly realized that i made a mistake and it's too late. i want him back should i start calling and going to his house to beg?",
    "i haven't really thought of that yet. he has a pretty short temper actually. i know he is really mad at me so i think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again.",
    "yeah, that's true. i have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and i don't want to let them get to him before i can get him back. i want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together.",
    "i can try that, i think he might be responsive at first if i dont set him off. all of his friends hate me so i have nobody on my side right now. should i try to get his friends to like me again? is that an way i could use to get him to want me again?",
    "i can understand what you mean. i need to think this through.",
    "well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. i liked being with someone so popular. he wasn't always nice to me and is why i wanted to be with someone else for a short time. he used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes.",
    "my friends always said that i could do better and that he didn't deserve me. he gave me statis in our town and everyone wanted to be his girlfriend so i think i liked the attention, yes.",
    "i really liked being with the popular guy who everyone looked up to. my parents don't like him at all and have wanted us to break up the whole time we were together.",
    "i have never thought of it this way. you are making a lot of good points that i never thought of before. when i think about him i miss the way i felt in terms of being popular. i don't really miss him as a person.",
    "my friend, my best friend, has a new friend and hardly has time for me anymore, we have been friend for over ten years. this hurts",
    "i am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off.",
    "its so annoying and hurtful",
    "i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful",
    "i know, but its hard when you are the one still stuck, im not ready for change.",
    "i could try to focus on myself",
    "i agree, i need to focus more on myself",
    "its hard to but i know that its time to focus on me more",
    "do you have any suggestions that i can focus on",

    "i just find the work mundane and way too remedial",
    "did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job?",
    "what types of skill can i gain online?",
    "so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that i can complete?",
    "i have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there?",

    "yes but i may change my mind",
    "yes i have been networking as i go",

    "oh yea that can make things difficult, but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over.",
    "yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue",
    "i would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her.",
    "please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now",
    "i would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much.",
    "yeah i like to play football",
    "yeah sure",
    "now im feeling well because of you",

    "maybe i can think that way in time, but right now i don't know what to do with myself.",
    "that's true, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it right now.",
    "yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays.",
    "i suppose i just need to practice more.",

    "i really cared for this one, and we were together for so long.",
    "you had a fight with your partner? i'm sorry, it's the worst when people fight over what's supposed to be something nice.",
    "it just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn't take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it.",
    "you think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it?",
    "he does get upset very easily.",
    "i do think it is important to take some time and breathe.",
    "that's part of why i'm so sad that he ended the relationship.",
    "and we would fight over the smallest things, it was really stupid.",
    "you said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on christmas?",
    "instead we fought and broke up.",
    "but it probably is for the best.",
    "i have seen things only get worse in a situation like yours. i think h needs to accept that he needs to grow up.",

    "and i don't know what to do",
    "i don't even know what they will decide",
    "nobody know who is next",
    "many people are affecting because of pandemic",
    "i see. startimg your own business is something that could help. what do you think?",

    "hello, i'm doing okay, wbu?",
    "yeah that's true",
    "it sounds crazy, and i don't have any proof but i have this feeling. the way they talk around each other makes me nervous",
    "i'm scared when it is just the two of them here at home. and they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in",
    "not really specifics. it's more of a just in general sort of thing. i know them both really really well, so i am just picking up on tiny little details",
    "i have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it's crazy i would think something like that. idk... i don't want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it's really nothing. i don't know if there is actually something i should be worried about, or if i am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons",
    "i don't know who that is",
    "does she do live talks or videos? or is she more in online writing",
    "oh that's cool! i will have to check that out. so you think maybe i am feeling this way is because i have shame or vulnerability in the relationship?",
    "anyway, i find her imspirational when i have doubts",
    "yeah.. that's true. i think it's a good idea to learn more about how i'm feeling before i make any rash decisions",
    "it was shown in my class in like 9th grade",
    "things are weird for everyone right now",

    "hi. i am mike. live in central kansas and have been very depressed",
    "i lost my job due to covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move.. __unk__ but then job closed",
    "i hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic",
    "i did not make enough to get unemployment they said. i have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is i am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or mcdonalds or anything like that. whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away",
    "i will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month, we shop for the month and i stay with my siter.",
    "well i have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as i am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing",
    "yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a very risky idea. and that i need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum. i do appreciate the advice and ideas",
    "and appreciate that especially during the current situation.",
    "you as well.",
    "oh i did want to ask. do you have any experience in either alaska or arizona? i know vastly differnt places but when i move i had been considering those. among others. alska seems so risky but potentially amazing but it is rather far away from __unk__ main america\"",

    "i am really depressed because of my recent break up",
    "yeah",
    "i was with her for more then 2 years and without her everthing seems incomplete",
    "what should i do now?",
    "well, if the break up is still fresh, it will take some time before you start feeling yourself again. breaking up with someone can be as devastating as a death. because you mourn the loss of the person.",
    "what i need right now is to distract my mind and think about something else",
    "i mostly play soccer",
    "that could be a great distraction. you could start practicing soccer again. you definitely have more time for it now.",

    "probably",
    "thank you",
    "no no no... me the super optimist",
    "will achieve my goals with proscanation or not",
    "i have pills of written works, short stories, poetry novels and a few paintings, but not published yet. i might do that",
    "there is always __unk__ next year\" so i am waiting for it...",
    "thanks for talking to me, very supportive.",
    "yeah. nice talking to you. will leave you now.",
    "okay, can you press quit first as i am not able to do that from my end : ).",
    "i am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. i am very worried i may have to close and i won't be able to pay my bills.",
