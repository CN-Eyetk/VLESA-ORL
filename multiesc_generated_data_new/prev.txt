i am always depressed and the upcoming holidays are making it a lot worse.
hi i am okay, a little bit sad though.
well with the holidays coming up i have been very stressed and nervous about what i am going to do.
yes. i am a college student and i live on campus. the day before i moved in my dad said some unforgivable things to me and we haven't spoke since. i have no choice but to go live at home over the break but i am very scared about it.
more for the situation in general. i know we will not speak but we will constantly be running into each other, my house is not big. and i have no car to escape it.
thank you i appreciate that. i will be fine making it over the thanksgiving break but i am more nervous about covid - 19 sending us home for good.. not many to be honest. i have a hamster but he is at school with me so nothing at home to go back to.
yes it is very strange and i know that it is a big stressor on all of us, i don't want to sound selfish.. yes i am bringing him home with me so that is my little piece of joy that is coming along.
well thank you that does help me to feel better. yes i am happy to bring him home with me and hoping i can have my niece over to intro duce her to him.
it is surely my goal! i appreciate your kind words. i would love that if i had a car i could do that but i am not sure how much she will be able to come to my house. i am going to try though!
that is very true i didn't even think of that to be honest! i may use that along the way, thank you for the reminder!
thank you! well i appreciate your help a lot and hope you have a great day!
i have been put into sadness due to pressure from my employer who is threatening to down size the manpower at work. i am really sad because my supervisor has mentioned to me that i am going to be one of those who are going to lose their jobs.
hai. my name is tom and i really need your help.
i am really sad and stressed up knowing that i am soon losing my job due to the effects of corona virus. for sure if i lose my job now i might go to depression because i have a family to take care of.
are there any ways you know that could help me convince my boss that that it is not the right time to cut down on manpower?
incase i lose the job, are there ways that can help me stay out of stress of losing the job? i am worried that losing a job may cause me a lot of harm since my bills depend on my current job.
i am really worried that getting another job during this season of corona is not easy, that is the stress that is almost killing me. sure i do believe myself.
not really. do you happen to know any that can sustain me?
its ok my friend i believe that god will provide. i am an architect.
sure, thanks a lot for your kind words.
god bless you too friend, please keep safe. bye.
i can't seem to make any friends - always left on my own and no-one to talk to
oh hello. i'm having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. i don't have any.
well it's more that i think i've never had friends. not anyone i can confide in or laugh with.
i don't think i'd want to let them know how unhappy i am to be honest.
i've never heard of friendship apps to be honest.
i'd really like someone local though, someone who i could meet up with face to face and who knew my town.
i don't know if it's more than that. what do you mean? the problem is that i lack the courage to go out and meet people.
oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person?
that's so cool. thanks for your help.
i think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but i'm too scared to do anything about it as i don't want her to leave me. i feel ashamed of myself but i can't help it
i am ok thanks but have an unusual issue. i think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but i'm too scared to do anything about it as i don't want her to leave me. i feel ashamed of myself but i can't help it.
yes it is but i should be leaving her and moving on. problem is she is a 9 and i'm a 5 and i love her. pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if i ignore it she may just leave things as they are.
what happened out of interest when you had the conversation?
i know. i'm a typical man and i like the feeling when she is on my arm. i feel like the cat that has got the cream. it's superficial and sad i know. i knew this would never last. she is just too attractive for me. everyone told me iwas'punching above my weight'and now they will all be laughing if it ends..
i'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. she is always texting and vague when i ask who she is messaging. she goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when i called her office her colleague said they got back after two..
that's just it. i kind of know she is cheating but i haven't approached it with her because i'm scared see will just leave and i'll be a laughing stock. i suppose i'm a joke either way!
very true. i suppose i have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think i should just talk to her?
not at all. i appreciate your candour.
all this is tied up with who and i know i'm valuing the wrong things. you are right actually. i think some of this comes from my low self - esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe i need to deal with it directly.
impending academic deadlines
hello i am taking a break from my studies to talk. i am fine thanks. hope you are doing well also. i am just kind of anxious and stressed out with impending academic deadlines.
yeah i have been procrastinating and taking my sweet time with things since it's online and basically i do things on my own time..
2 courses. but i am pretty much using full time capacity on them. devoting full - time i mean.
have to finish one at the end of this month and end of next month for the other one.
i have done both methods. i definitely prefer in - school studies..
i am just disappointed that i have been slacking off and procrastinating. no it's just that it's a different avenue. i have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. i think it's because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow..
yeah i take breaks in between..
but sometimes a lot more breaks or longer breaks than intended or i should. yeah definitely. sorry to hear that.. it's like everyday is the same and i can't go out to refresh my mind or have a change of pace such as going to the gym or go out for a run. whereas before the pandemic, i can switch gears that way and come back refreshed. like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm.
i see. yeah it's good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual.. sometimes i listen to music but i find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. but i do listen to music sometimes when i am on assignments.. i also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. it does help. and i know i can pass the courses and on time but just that i am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as i know i have done much better before. so i am missing that sense of urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity.,
i see. that's a good idea. i was also thinking i should have a regular workout routine at home again because i used to work out much more daily, even at home..
working out does help me focus and be productive.. thank you and i do agree with you on the pandemic. but this is a part of my mistake too but i think coming away from our conversation, i am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it..
yeah that's another thing. it does work better for me if i were to write down some sort of itinerary of what i should get through today, etc. so you're right.. well thank you for listening then and providing some very helpful input.. yeah you've been more than helpful! thank you..
just can't wait to finish the two courses these two months and i can finally relax and enjoy the holidays at least. thank you very much. and i hope you best of luck with all your endeavours!
my two friends are shaming me for not donating more per year to charities. one of them is the president of a local non-profit.
it is christmas and my friends say that i do not donate enough to charity. they are putting me on a guilt trip. my one old friend is the president of a local non - profit.
i am not making much income with the covid - 19, either.
two different ( so - called ) friends of mine need to get a life.
yeah, people don't know that just because my two friends go " way back, " does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. what should i do about these two ( so - called ) friends?
no, they don't know that i am in financial trouble myself. covid - 19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... things were great, this time last year.
well, i used to donate a lot in year's past.
my friends may like to know that i am trading time.... instead of donating money.
yes, you make a good point.
the proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight.
yeah......
well, you have been helpful. thank you. good bye.
happy holidays.
its just a general depression that i can't seem to shake. being put on the bench at my job continuously makes me feel not good at anything.
a bit sad. more depressed. its just i keep getting benched at work. i'm not really sure what do to. * to do.
i'm not really sure what i'm doing wrong.
what can i do though?
hrm. i could do that! they are hard to get a hold of though.
yes... hrm. that may work. how can i stop being depressed all the time though..
how did you fix the issue? i work at home and its like just trying to reach out - they are always busy.
ok, so just keep pushing and getting good work done?
maybe i can try that. thank you. i'll give it a shot.
hrm... that's a good point! i hadn't thought of it that way.
i think that will work. it maybe what's keeping me down. i'll try yoga too. i'll give it a shot and just talk with him when i see him online next time. he isn't online that often because we have 2 separate computers each for our work. well... i hope you have a wonderful night! thank you for all your help!
yes i agree.
thank you for your help! me too. i'll try what you have suggested and see if that doesn't work out well. who knows, maybe it just my project that i'm on.
i have a friend who knew me since i was little, she is closer to my mother's age so she is kinda like my aunt growing up. she always treat me like i was little. i understand that she knew me since i was little. but i'm a grown woman now and i want our relationship to go far and grow more. i tried to explain it to her but she is not getting it. it's made me feel sad that we can't move our relationship further.
i'm feeling pretty good right now..
i have a friend who knew me since i was little. she is a little older than me. she still treat me like i'm still little. i tried to explain to her that i'm a grown woman and i grew out of lot of things when i was a kid..
she still didn't get it. i want our relationship to move further but with her like this. i feel sad. is there anything i can do?
that's true. i didn't think about it. should i approach her and talk about it before?
yeah, that's definitely true. i know she is a good person. so i would give her a chance and we can talk about it before.
she have a younger brother that is 9 years younger. she used to be only child for a while before her brother was born..
maybe that's why. she have different personality than me. she is more into logical thinking and she love people and has bubbly personality. while i'm emotional but are social butterfly and after a while, i would need a break from people..
to be honest, there are some times when she made me cry or mad when i get home. i think that over the time and the more older i get, the more i would knowledge my relationship with her..
i do have other friends that i could purse the relationship farther. i think i just felt bad that i known her for years and she is a good person. it's just not what i need right now..
yeah, thank you! you certainly helped me..
you too! stay safe and healthy!.
i don't know what to do with my life, i am not working and not going to college. i am just sitting in my desk, sleeping, and eat 24/7.
i'm good. how about you?
still pretty cold and dry in here, how about there?
just in my long pajamas with heater. i don't really know what to do anymore, i am just lazy on everything.
not really i'm living with my family but i don't really talk to them anymore i'm just in my room all day.
it's something else.
just a fight from years ago and i decided to not talk to them anymore..
i talk to my friends online, play games, watch movies, etc. i know, i should find a productive hobby.
like painting or learn new skills online like coding, anything that can improve my human capital.
a month maybe, idk depends on how much i can handle it.
i hope i don't get lazy this time and fully commit on this, thank you for the encouragement. sure, nice talking to you.
i live with my ex and he's having a break down and my current boyfriend lives far away and is struggling with addiction and money problems. i feel constantly worn down.
tired. i want to sleep all my problems away.
well the boyfriend for awhile the other thing for a day or two. i got a hold of a therapist but they won't talk to me for two days.
i am hoping it helps because i feel helpless, especially today and on edge.
i can't sleep through the day because i have kids but when my ex gets home i just go hide and try to sleep so it's typically late afternoon.
thank you. i feel very tired tho. i feel like i want every day to go by faster. the relationship i am in is a long distance relationship and i am supposed to go home to see him in ten days and i just want them to be over.
yes it may be. i'm not sure. i sometimes wake up panicking.
thank you. that is very supportive. i just dont know how to make the next ten days go by faster.
that's true. i thought about maybe playing video games.
maybe overwatch. i haven't been playing them much.
i am. but i have a hard time focusing as of late.
that's a great idea. that may help a lot with focus.
dystopian fantasy style books. and also historical nonfiction.
lauren destefano. her series the chemical garden trilogy is my favorite.
that's also another good idea. i haven't read all of her bookis.
i do but they're closed because of covid.
i can try. the bookstores are open.
sorta but not that close but i can take the bus out there.
that's a great idea.
i try but i get too stresed.
thank you. that's true.
thank you i will take that advcie.
my friend's boyfriend stole my nintendo switch.
yes. i invited my friend over to watch my new puppy while i painted my room because my dog has seperation anxiety and can't be alone. then she showed up with her new boyfriend.
well i dont know him and my stuff was all out in the living room where he was alone for most of the day. i actually didnt suspect anything would happen at first.
yes, after they left, i started putting my stuff back in my room and realized the purse i keep my nintendo switch in was gone.
i've known her for 8 years. but this guy is very new. they're not even officially together.
yes, so i called her and asked her if she saw my bag and she got defensive. she started talking about how much money he has and how he doesnt have to steal.
but she should care about me more!! she barely knows him.
last time we went out for brunch, he literally tried to make her pay for it! that's not the behavior of someone that has money like she claims. she's delusional.
i should tell her that i am thinking about calling the cops, at least. or maybe not cuz she might tell him. then he can get rid of it. i think she is working with him, maybe, or at least covering for him.
i think she would cover him, maybe, or try to avoid the truth. but no i dont think she would plot with him.
i'm sure she'll come forward if i give her time. thank you for your help.
i am in a crisis over my employer not having enough money to pay me. it is really causing me to be fearful.
it has been a while. i have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. i think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. the current economic climate has really made me fearful.... not sure if i am going to be able to keep my job.
somewhat. but, my fears are relevant because i don't know if i will always have a job.
do you know what i mean? what say u? i have some, but they have their own problems to deal with. everyone has problems. do you know what i mean?
it is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, i think i need to find a good support chain, for sure. what say u? you take alooonnng time to respond.
i am having a hard time.... ok, i will look some of them online. i need some financial planners to help as well. many americans are hurting.
any other advices? what else can you advise me on? should i look elsewhere for jobs? i will have to try that. maybe it can help me ease my mind.
it is not easy right now. that's for sure.. i am wondering if i could do lyft or uber. i think a side hustle could work, perhaps?
do you think i am thinking rationally? i could give it a try.... childhood traumas are tough for sure. i am a fearful person.
thanks a lot. i appreciate you support. : ) i think that your advice will help. thank you for the chat.
thank you. good bye.
i learned that my friend's husband was shot and killed over a drug deal. he was high at the time. my daughter carpools with his daughter every day and he was often the driver. was he high when he was driving her around? i don't know how to act around my friend. did she know?
i am fine thank you. how are you?
yes. i am having trouble figuring out how to handel a situation with a friend.
her husband was justshot and kiled over a drug deal. he was high on drugs at the time. my dayghter and his daughter are good friends and we carpool with them every day. he was often the driver not my friend. was he high when he was driving my daughter arround? did my friend know he was on drugs?
very true. i really never even considered that!
yes. i am very relieved. he was recently in a car accident before he died. luckily no one was hurt and the girls were not in the car! he totaled his brand new truck though.
definitely trying to be!
yes she received payouts from several large life insurance policies so they are safe financially. just a mess emotionally.
thank you so much! you were very helpful!
i'm finding the covid online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. i want to stop school, but i don't think i can afford to. i need to get done with school.
hi, how are you?
i'm feeling really anxious these days. i'm finding the covid online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. i want to stop school, but i don't think i can afford to. i need to get done with school.
school was always hard. now it's gotten harder. i think a lot of people are stressed..
last semester and this semester. it feels like a lot longer though.
a balance in life. i spend so much time online. i'm always staring at a screen. i would like to get aware from the computer.
yeah, i can't wait for things to return to normal. until then, i don't know what i can do to feel normal.
no, i haven't. i thought it wouldn't be the same as really hanging out. i don't drink. i do like to play board games though.
that's true. i wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren't interested. it's not the same thing to play with strangers.
that's great. i wish i had kept in touch with my friends from those days. i'm not really much for just socializing though. i like some kind of activity, like games.
ok. not really sure how to form a group. i want to reach out, but so many people are flaky. they makes plans then bail at the last minute..
ok. will do. i'll see what i can get done. thanks for your help.
friends keep calling my face ugly
i'm doing good. i need some advice.
lately, my friends started to make jokes about my face being ugly. they even called my face as flat as a pan! what should i do? i see them everyday on the bus.
i did and they respond by saying that they are just joking and that i'm handsome. but it's starting to get on my nerves because it's all they make fun about every time they see me!
haha i would hope so. still though, it makes me want to avoid them when i go to school on the bus. what do you think i should do then?
should i just beat them up with my backpack.
there's another bus route. should i just take that instead.
i think i will. their comments make me very insecure.
the teacher would probably make fun of me!. thanks it's hard to look in the mirror now.
i'll try to be positive for once. do you believe working out will help.
awesome. i will start to take care of myself and not worry about others then.
not sure how to explain that i want out of marriage
ok i guess. i do not know how to tell my husband that i am lonely and i want out of the marriage.
he is not one you can talk to he usually just brushes things off.
yes he tells me it’s just in my head and i could just go out with him, but he drinks then to much so i do not like going out with him.
just when he goes out i do not go with him i do not drink and drive. and he hangs with some obnoxious people.
he would go to sleep, and then he thinks i am crazy he says we are no kids anymore that need to go on a date we are married.
i want that but i doubt he will talk he tells me he has no problems i have them, and all it does is i doubt myself. i turned this situation in every direction and i just am not able to find a solution.
you know what i like that idea. maybe you are right i might get then some self esteem as well again.
thank you you are very kind.
after braeking up with the partner i had lot of stress and depression in my life.i was facing really a mental stress without my boyfriend
was not so good.
it really very stress full and depressed situation. why your day is boring.
my suitaion is really very sad and depressed.
i had breakup with my partner, it was really very horrible to me to overcome.
i tried a lot but i couldnt forget him at all. he was not abusive at all.
i was really a bad suitation. i am stressed and depressed right now.
yes i am alone. i didnot lose my job. i had a break with my partner so i am stressed. i am want to over come my stress and depression. what can i do for it.
k i will do it.
in this can i overcome the stress.
thank you for the suggestion.
it will be really good miracle. thank you. bye.
i lost 5 borrowed books, i collected those books in my school library
evening.
i lost those books, i cannot even explain, how it happen.
i price one of the books, amazon said 1000. yes.
where will i g et almost 3 thousand dollars. it is too painful.
yes, i do.
school, should just give me enough time to find the books.
i am trying to find that out, i packed them inside one bag, may be someone carried the bag or i misplace them.
i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me.
you are right.
yes, it is fuck giving me headache.
i just need time, i will check the cctv of my room, and check around.
i guest so.
yes.
i appreciate.
need a second job to pay off credit card bills
i'm good, busy. i need another job to pay more bills.
yes somewhat. i can pay it off within 2 - 3 years without a second job. id like to pay it off faster though.
i think so. im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don't know about getting another job.
i agree 100 %. been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot.
i currently do that. it's hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money.
absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out.
no i haven't tried those yet. do i have to pay for those scripts?
so i could make more money on mturk than i am now by using those?
oh wow, thank ya! i'll look into that. mts is a script? which script should i use?
thank ya! i'll check it out.
thank ya! have a good night. bye.
need to declutter my house and dont know where to start
im ok kinda stressed.
im feeling very overwhelmed and cant get anything done cause i dont know where to start! i want to declutter my house but dont know where to start.
but there are so many thinggs to do and ideas i have.
should i start in one room or one group of things and collect them from all the rooms?
well i seem to start and them i end up jumoing to another thing! jumping.
thanx that helps cause i start feeling defeated.
i have no type of supportin my life and it really does effect me. thanx for all your positively.
im gonna start again tomorrow with more faith in myself.
u really helped my negitivity.
ur awesome.
are u still there. do you think making lists are a good idea.
i just feel generally down.
i am feeling very depressed lately. like a constant pressure that i don't know exactly what it is.
i think the days getting shorter makes it worse.
do you have any tips on how to overcome it?
yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. i like to stay up, but when it's time to get up i dread it. bad cycle.
lol... yes it is. the pandemic heightens all our awareness of time and mortality.
i worry too that the u. s. government has no idea what it's doing. and the people at large are all losing their mental health.
i guess it's like you said before, we can only change ourselves.
alcoholism
i really want a drink.
i'm an alcoholic.
just had a stressful day. depressed because if i go get a beer i wont stop. no i guess it wouldnt. it still sucks. i want to be normal lol. i get that thought in my head and its like i become obsessed.
hmmm like what?
i hate my mind.
i actually was thinking of starting again. i did about 15 min this morning. i used to workout like 2 hours a day lol. thank you.
i actually just switched from beachbody to les mills. i got bored with beachb body workouts lol. having something different is nice.
i got on a sweet tooth. which i'm mad at myself for lol. i sued to never eat candy and junk food. the past few weeks... ugh.
ive always been really hard on myself, i dont know why.
maybe i should make some tea tonight. i knowi have to love myself. i just cant figure out how lol.
honestly it was good getting stuff off my chest. i appreciate you listening.
just alot of different things have happened over last couple of months. it is the holidays and i cant be around family because i tested positive for covid
i am okay. thank you.
it is pretty good. we all get along good. no issues.
oh i am sorry to hear that..
has the pandemic affected your work life at all?.
not me so much. business was slow for quite a while because nobody was really working. but it affected my husband, because everytime anyone in our house got sick he had to leave work becase his work didnt allow anybody to be there if anybody in there household was sick.. so he missed quite a bit of work.
it was nerve wracking because you never knew how long he was going to be out of work for. his work changed their policy about when he could come back everytime he was out.
oh yes it defintely was. he is out again because i just tested positive for covid. so he will be out of work for two weeks.
thats okay.
most things cause me nervousness. i am a very anxious person. not sure why..
yea i try to do that too. most times its playing a game on my tablet or phone or something. it is very difficult feelling like this all the time.. i am trying to not let things stress me out as much..
i broke up with my partner because she was constantly neglecting me. she showed little interest in doing things together and i had enough of trying to please her. she ends up with a new guy just two weeks later.
good how are you.
just been having a rough time.... recently broke up with my girlfriend.
trying to avoid thoughts about her, but every where on social media she is posting about her new guy. it is hard to escape the sadness.
yeah it is. well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. we tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. i was the one who broke things off because i know longer felt much love coming from her. i felt neglected and i thought a break up was the best solution. i did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. i was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts.
yeah it has been difficult and i know i will make it through. it is just difficult to get through break ups these days. unless you disconnect you can't avoid the other person.
yeah i was thinking of maybe organizing a hunting / fishing / camping trip with my buddies over winter break. that could help get me out of the digital world and would help me spend quality time with my friends.
yeah i think that is probably what i will end up doing. it will probably help the mental health of the entire friend group, but especially me right now.
thank you for the help and the advice. i think i will follow through and make the trip happen. any tips on eventually getting back out in the dating game in these strange times?
thanks i appreciate that. i can spend some time focusing on my career and relationships with friends before looking for another romantic endeavor. i appreciate your help with this situation.
since my divorce, i am constantly worried about being able to pay my bills and general sad most of the time. the covid issue is making it worst.
just feeling sad.
not being able to leave the house with covid. plus my hours were cut at work.
yes it sucks. i live alone now so there really hard sometimes. i tend to watch tv and lot and watch youtube videos. nothing productive.
yes, i have one close friend that i talk to every now and then. its not like it use to be.
we used to be able to go out and have a few beers together..
i hope that this vaccine thing is reason and we can get back to the norm..
good idea..
i like to do home repairs. maybe i can find a group for that.
do you use any other social media for connecting with new people.
true. i have to change out a few old style electrical plugs. maybe i can do something on that?
i saw a few tiktok videos but never post a video. is it hard to post on there?
oh. okay.
i noticed all the videos are so short. i think i will have to use youtube for a longer video? i never used snapchat. is that the one disappears after some time.?
cheated on my girlfriend and she's found out and gone of with another man. i'm absolutely distraught.
hi.
well i'm distraught.
because my girlfriend has left me.
four years.
well i'm not really, especially as she'd gone off with someone else. but i'm to blame which makes it worse.
i cheated on her on a drunken night. it was a one - off and i regret it terribly. but she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain.
yeah, i'm not saying i deserved it just wish she had. but no, not really. no - one who would understand.
yeah i feel so low.
it's difficult though, to open up.
they won't think i'm to blame?
oh yeah, that's a good point.
no you've been helpful thanks.
i feel really sad all the time. i don't know why.
i'm not sure. i can't find a reason. my health is fine. i have friends. i have a place to live.
yes, that's right. i feel like my life is not going in the right direction. in fact, i'm not going anywhere.
no, not really. i don't know what to talk about. i just feel flat. something's wrong. i don't know what.
how did you do that? i really need some guidance here. what do i do?
you met with your friends? i've tried meeting with my friends. i feel ok when i'm with them, but then later, i feel sad again. i can't spend all my time with my friends, of course. they have things to do. so do i.
i'm trying to be positive. it doesn't seem to work. i don't know how to change my mood without chemicals.
no, i haven't tried yoga. i thought it was for women. therapy? you mean like a shrink?
oh, meditating by myself? i would need someone to help me learn. is yoga expensive? i don't have much money.
ok. i'll check out youtube. do i need special clothes or equipment? or incense or candles or lotoins or something? i'm just a regular guy.
ok. i can do that. i bet there is something on youtube about meditation. i'll give it a try. thanks for your help! have a great day!
i've had a drinking problem for a few years now, and i know that i need to seek help now. i just am having a hard time finding the motivation to, and i'm having a hard time with being worried about being judged for my drinking and other addiction problems. i'm worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a rehab will view me, and any one else that i have to share my story with. i'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that i've made that have gotten me to this point in my life.
i'm alright, honestly i'm feeling rather ashamed. the reason for that and the problem that i'm facing is that i've had a drinking problem for quite a few years now, and i'm only 24 years old. right now in my life i'm ready to seek help, but i'm having a lot of anxiety about it because i'm very worried about how others will judge me. i'm worried about how the counselors will see me, how others at a facility might view me, and any one else that i will have to share my story with when getting treatment and how they might view me. i'm ashamed of myself, my life, and the choices that i've made that have gotten me here and i guess my problem is that i just dont know how to get over these extreme anxieties and worries so that i can just finally make the step that i need so desperately and get help.
yes of course i didn't hear it go off, my apologies. i really appreciate that, it really is helpful knowing that i'm not the only one who feels this way. i really know that that's what i need to do, and i am trying my best to get over my fears and just do it ya know.
no matter how hard it seems, maybe it wont be when i actual do it.
thank you, i do feel better about going now. i just dont know what to expect and it can be scary sometimes.
you're right, and that's what i probably need also is some friends who are in similar positions.
they'd understand my situation more, and be good influences.
alright, i havent looked into those but thats a good idea. i definitely will tonight.. of course, you really have. i appreciate your advice, it really did help calm my mind about the whole situation. thank you again ( :
realizing im almost done with current degree
i do have an idea about it but i am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something i wish i hadn't chosen.
i suppose you're right, i think i don't have confidence in myself that what ever i do choose, i will be good at it. good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time.
but what if that thing is your career choice?
i guess thats right. all i care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine. thank you for your help.
yes, it is very rewarding to do so, it should be a part of everyone's life choices. i agree with you on that.
i am sure you are right, i just get caught up in my thoughts too much. have a great day! no thank you. are you still there.
i have been struggling since i lost my job. i have been on the lookout for a new job, tried doing menial jobs just to get by, but nothing seems to be available.
hi, i'm pretty much down. trying to keep my head afloat.
i lost my job some months back and it hasn't really been easy for me.
sometimes when i enter a place where my friends are, they tend to go silent when i enter the room. yes. its been months now and nothing yet.
i'm pretty sure they were talking about me. 2 of myy friends have been helping me with rent money. and i'm pretty sure they must be fed up.
yes i have. that's what helps with feeding and getting some little things at home.
and sometimes i pay back little of what they loan me since i know i cant pay all of it.
i've playfully asked why did they all go silent when i walked in, but they try changing the topic to something else. i babysit sometimes.
it's not as easy as you say it. i feel i'm no longer needed. like an outcast.
okay. thanks.
i hope so too. cause at this point, i think i'm going to lose it.
my partner cheated on me and now i am extremely sad.
i am feeling very sad.
my partner of 9 months cheated on me.
it is over permanently...
yeah i just miss having someone there for me.
what is tlc.
ok yeah your story is very inspirational to me. maybe this was needed in order to find the right person.
i am now doing mturk to get my mind off of it to make some extra money.
yeah the only problem is i am barely getting any money from this. do you have any tips onto how i can make more money /
i mean 15 minutes for 2 $ doesn't seem very lucrative. but i guess it ads up.
yeah exactly and i have more pressing matters at hand than a girlfriend because like i said, i am in need of money right now since.
i think talking to you has benefited me a lot so thank you for that. i am feeling happy right now.
yeah thats what it seems like. how can i make sure you get the most money from this.
ok got it. i met my ex through tinder. and then we started going on dates and we both seemed to like each other.
yeah it really makes it easy to meet new people.
bye.
remote working is unfavorable
i've been remote working for the entire pandemic. at first, it was great. i didn't go into the office very often before, so i felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. but now i wonder if i am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction.
yes, it is of customer service nature. i provide expertise and technical products. i often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. i have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. challenging face - to - face, and i have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way.
thanks. it helps to know that i'm not alone. most often, i work independently my work. involves a lot of explaining and justification. before we just all sat in the same room and worked together.
so, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues?
ah, something more casual?
thank you! i will suggest that my organization arrange these. we can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies, or some such. i will pass these suggestions on! have a great holiday season!
i am self employed, and my job is at a halt due to covid 19. i am very anxious about when i will be able to return to work, and my current financial situation
hello, i'm not sure if there is any help? without knowing when i can return to work, i will probably remain anxious about the unknown.
i am self employed, selling event tickets on the internet, but because of covid, all events are postponed until it is safe to gather in large numbers.
thank you ; fortunately, i have been able to collect unemployment assistance, especially created for self employed people during this difficult time. however, that is due to expire in a few weeks, so once again i am growing anxious about finances.
yes, i try to walk outdoors every day, for at least 30 minutes. it does help a lot. but with the weather turning colder, that may be difficult to continue.
not yet ; it is very difficult for me to ask for help. but i may need to do so in the near future. i am fortunate to have a close network of family and friends that i can count on.
i would be open to seeking other employment online ; work from home on the computer. any suggestions?
thanks! i will check it out. in the meantime, any other suggestions for dealing with anxiety?
and you as well. take care, and happy holidays!
my mom does not understand me. i will say something and she thinks i am saying something else.
i am just a little angry. my mother and i had another blow - up.
it is why i am angry. this occurs at least every other day. i say something harmless and she thinks i am saying it in a way that is rude or something.
i do not know for sure where to start. if i try to tell her that is not what i mean it is like she doesn't understand?
for example today i was just saying i like the food she had cooked us for supper. she took that to mean i never liked the food she made before. she says i do not appreciate her and i should be grateful to have her.
maybe it was the way she was brought up that she is so sensitive.
but they should not take how they feel on others right? but i know i have to be understanding.
can you relate to this situation?
maybe i could just take deep breath and kind of step back a minute before i respond.
i guess the best time to do that was when she is in a very good mood.
but what if she thinks me helping her out is criticizing the way she does things? that seems like the way she would be.
i will try this. it is worth a shot. we can't go through life being upset at each other.
i appreciated the help. i was just so upset. i didn't want to talk to anyone in our family and have them take sides or make them uncomfortable.
i will try to say things that don't sound confrontational from now on.
thank you for the believing in me. thank you for your help.
i will be losing my job in january. i am very worried about finding a new one.
yes and that worries me even more. more people competing for the same jobs. ( 2 )
i will have to do a new resume definitely. it's been awhile. ( 3 )
i'll have to think on that, i have a friend that might be able to help but it's been awhile for both of us ( 4 )
well i don't think they are hobbies, but there are things that need to be done around the house. guess i can keep myself busy at least ( 5 )
yes, but i know i'll also have a lot of work to do to get ready to find a new job. i'm really hoping i can find one before i lose this one ( 6 )
i looked at indeed and i did apply to one thing. but when it came back to me it said that 4970 other people had applied for the same job! ( 7 )
i wish i knew how to make myself stand out more. so many people are out there looking for work. ( 8 )
i'm an accountant ( 9 )
well, with numbers at least! i just worry about companies that aren't able to be open, well they won't need an accountant. ( 10 )
not being able to see family and friends due to covid.
i am not feeling the best. i have been having some depression, because of not being able to see friends and family during this pandemic.
i try to message them as much as possible and call them on the phone but it is just not the same as actually getting to give the a hug and see them in person.
yes. that works for some of my family but i have family in the nursing home that does not have access to computers. i haven't seen them in several months. it just breaks my heart.
yes. i have some very dear friends that have helped me a lot. i guess the depression is just worse because it is the holidays and this is the first year that i haven't got to spend it with my extended family members.
yeah. i have a little dog that has been my cuddle buddy. i have had him for 13 years so he has seen me ugly cry many times. what are some things you do to deal with depression?
that sounds like some good advice. i think i will try to find a good podcast or a good comedy series that i like and spend time doing that. it's hard to be sad when you are watching something funny or listening to something funny. thank you for the good advice and the listening ear.
that is so true. i guess we tend to feel guilty if we feel happy since there is so much sadness in the world right now. but you are so right about the fact that we will come out on the other side. it helps to remember that bad things don't last forever.
yes. i live in the country so i can go for nice walks when the weather is nice. staying safe is definitely important right now.
yes that is exactly what i do. thank you so much for your help today. you have made me feel better just having someone to vent to.
yes. it the weather is very pretty here today. as a matter of fact, i think i am fixing to go for a nice walk. i hope you have a wonderful day and thank you for listening.
a few days ago i fell walking down some stairs and chipped my two front teeth and also broke my foot. i need to get surgery on my foot, and get my teeth fixed at the dentist with a couple crowns.
hi.
i am not doing so great. i fell down some stairs the other day and broke my foot and chipped my two front teeth.
i am grateful for my family they are taking care of me but i am on crutches and am in a boot when i am not icing my foot.
yes i am struggling with some depression just because i am feeling a bit isolated with the broken foot along with covid going on.
thank you i appreciate that! yes i am getting surgery like 2 days before christmas so this christmas should definitely be interesting to say the least haha.
yes exactly. i got my teeth fixed a couple days ago as well so that was good too! i am really leaning on my family for support but just felt like asking for some outside help which is why i am talking to you right now lol.
i think i pretty much got everything i need from you - i just needed to vent i think. so we can stop talking now or whenever you have to leave.
you too!
it is finals week and i have a lot to do. i have been having bad dreams about my grades and future.
i am okay just anxious.
i believe i am going to fail all my finals for college.
yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus.
that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks.
i try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus.
yes i. do sleep for at least 10 hours. i also take 20 minute power naps because i have read somewhere it helps.
yes i live with a roommate and we are in the same program, but i sometimes feel dumb when i study with her.
it is fun when we study together,. i also forget to eat sometimes because im so stressed.
yes thats the only thing that is keeping me going. this is only for a few days and it will soon end and i will have a break.
i can't wait to be successful one day, but the thought of working also sc ares me. i fell be by myself. thank you so much, i feel relieved. i will take all your suggestions into consideration..
haven't been able to sleep for weeks. my mind just won't stop when i try.
hi, sarah. i am at my wits end. i feel like i am going crazy.
i am stressed out about having to move and i just can't seem to calm down when it is time to sleep..
i am moving in a month, but there is just so much to do before then.
i usually put my kids to bed and then try to relax for about an hour while i watch tv before i head to bed.
yes, i am a homeschooling mother of two..
a bath does sound really relaxing. i have tried some meditations.
thanks, i will have to try that. music does tend to calm me down. i don't know why i haven't tried that.
i really appreciate that help, i will try it for sure. i think it will be easier to focus on a meditation with someone talking me through it.
yes, but he has already moved to our new house because he is working on floors and stuff to get it ready. so i have been alone to stew in my worries.
yes, i am. but, my children are not very stressful. i think they help more than anything. i have wonderful children. i think it is just the thoughts of moving to a new place and the actual 20 hour drive in a moving truck that is scaring me. i really appreciate your support today. it is helpful to talk it out. your suggestions were also really good.
thank you so much! you have a great day : )
my husband quit his job to stay home with our teenage son who is very difficult and has been in legal trouble. my husband feels like it is important for him to be home more but this is putting a financial strain on us and our son is causing a lot of emotion conflict.
hello, i am looking for help in managing some depression.
i am feeling resentful towards my husband for quitting his job, and my son for being the reason that he quit his job.. my son's behavior is causing a lot of conflict in our house and my husband not working is putting a lot of financial stress on us.
i have a hard time not dwelling on the negative things going on. it's hard to see anything positive or feel hopeful for the future.
my son is very defiant and argues with us about everything we try and get him to do, but he expects us to give him money for fun things that he wants to do when he isn't willing to work or even help out around the house.
i try to go for a run every night, that does help..
it is hard to keep my emotions separate from what is going on with him.
yes, i could do better at that. i want him to have fun and do things with friends, but i want him to be willing to work for what he wants, too.. i do struggle with expectations. i want him to be someone that he is not willing to be, i need to let go of that and just let him be himself and not base my emotions on his choices.
i feel guilty sometimes taking time to do things that i like and that are away from my family. i can see that i need to do that more, though.
thank you, it is helpful to know that other people have felt the same way.
thank you!
my partner broke up with me but they did not tell me the reason why
hello.
yes, i feel like i am in depsression.
my partner broke up with me impromptu.
exactly, that is my current situation. i feel like my entire life has been rearranged. how did you deal with them and specifically what was your coping mechanism?
true, what ways would you suggest i use to approach my situation and get out of this state? it is very pathetic really when you think of it, halting all your life activities and plans just because a relationship ended.
close friends can really be helpful in such situations. yes, i do have a close friend even though i am very poor when it comes to opening up.
yes, i should do that because at the end of it all i still have myself to take care of.
opening up is a skill that i could do better at because i have never been the open type. but with a little practice i could get better at it. i have to get better no matter what. are there other tactics you can share with me with regards to my current situation?
waiting, thank you.
ooh too bad. could you just name a few then i can look them up on my own later?
ok that's rather helpful.
you have been of a very great help to me today. i feel better and ready to face the world.
my dad and i do not talk anymore even though we used to be close.
hello. it is a fine day, how about yourself?
that is awesome.
sort of stuck inside trying to make a dime but it is alright.
looking for a good job right now. i wanted to talk about a personal issue i have been having, though.
my father and i had a fight 2 years ago and haven't spoke since.
yeah i am afraid that these things can happen. it was only over material things.
it is weird because i called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense..
i would likely take advantage of an opportunity to be the bigger person.
that is probably decent advice.
i hope so too, but the opportunity seems tenuous.
threatening and disparagement haha.
my best friend is addicted to meth
i'm a little bummed because my friend is not only a junkie but he got arrested last week.
he got arrested for stealing to fund his addiction.
sadly my friend has been arrested a few times, spent time in prison, and is fully locked in his lifestyle. he's such a great person, very funny, nice, but he is lost.
he has alienated all of his friends, including me. i was the last one holding on.
yes. i know i have to let go. i've punished myself trying to stay in his life.
all drugs are bad, but meth is a truly evil drug. it's just rotting his soul and body. he believes he can't stop and you're right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now.
that's a good idea. i don't have many friends left, close friends that is, and this guy is my best friend of 20 years. we were in a touring rock band together. he's my last close friend.
i'm a single dad so my world is my children. i guess that's enough for me really. i just watch this guy sink and often feel like i should be doing something, but i think you're right.
my curly hair is so unruly
hi rose. i'm ok, but i get embarrassed about my curly hair.
they are unruly and not the pretty kind of curls. often get frizzy by the end of the day. it get's frustrating when i always look a mess.
it is long.
i started to cut it shorter last time, but my stylist said it would be big. it is hard to find the right product.. it is my personal opinion..
my friend likes my hair, but also says she can see that it is hard to manage.
i can totally relate to that. i think we always want what we dont have.
thank you. it does make it feel a little better. i hope you can get yours cut soon too.
yes, good idea. it seems it has been so long to be able to do this. maybe i need to think of a new style. had my second shot last thursday so i hope opportunities like a new stylist happen soon.
i will look on pinterest. good idea.
thank you. i can't believe how relieved i feel knowing i've had it. sick for a couple days but worth it. now i will feel like looking at pinterest more. maybe you are right and i need something new and fresh.
i am depressed because my girlfriend is thinking about leaving me.
i am very depressed. i found out that my girlfriend is cheating on me with my friend!
i have been with her for close to 2 years and now she has been cheating me right under my nose for the past few months! how foolish of me to blindly trust her... how did you deal with it?
but my family is away from me in another country. i can't even go back due to this stupid covid! i feel betrayed and like dying.
i actually broke my phone in anger and damaged her credit card. i feel like slapping both of them so hard that they forget where they came from! but i can't do anything. i am helpless.
why are girls like this?
i know, right! should i move on or should i take revenge?
i feel like giving it back to her though! but i may get into trouble... ya you are right! she is going downhill anyway. my friend just got fired and i actually got a much better job!
i caught my spouse cheating and broke up with her. the problem now is that i do not know where or how to start a new relationship.
i am trying to be fine and you?
thank you for your concern, i am just worried.
sorry about that. this is about my relationship.
i trusted my spouse but eventually disappointed. she got a jot in another town and she utilize the opportunity to be sleeping around.
i am planing to get married next year but things has changed now.
she knew pretty well how i felt. i don't want to have anything to do with her again.
i just want to move on with my life.
i don't that i can love her again.
yes, i want someone that i could trust.
yes, you understood my fear.
i will check that out, thank you very much.
i'm trying to make money on mturk and starting a youtube channel. money is a big concern for me.
no. that's my only income right now. it has led to a real crisis of self confidence to me.
i have. but i have health conditions that would mean covid - 19 would be very risky for me to get. so, i'm trying to work online. i'm trying to stay encouraged.
thanks. i appreciate that. what do you do to stay encouraged or confident?
that's a good idea. what sort of projects are you working on? job? hobby?
yep. you are right. thanks for the suggestion to get outside. i'm ging out for a walk tomorrow.
i will. good luck tonight. make that money! ; )
i have been feeling kinda down lately since my pet died. i miss her so much.
hello. not so good. i lost my cat recently. it surely feels... overwhelming at times.
yes, i had her for 11 years. she died of natural causes. i lived alone with her. the house feels extremely empty now...
no. my family lives in another country, and i really don't have any close friends.
i feel hopeless. alone. i feel like a chunk of myself passed along with her.
no. i fear that things like that may remind me of her and make me feel worse.
i used to play videogames before. now i'm not so sure i would enjoy them.
first person shooters and mmorpg's.
i just feel sad and it is hard to get my mind focused on anything. i am overwhelmed by the current state of the world.
hello. i just find life very hard. i have not been happy in months.
going out and getting things done. shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over.
both. i feel like the future is uncertain. not just for me but the world.
yes, but i feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful.
how do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things?
thanks. do you think things will get better any time soon?
i know people thinking the country will collapse soon. hard to deal with them.
i have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. especially during the holidays.
no but i did love that show as a kid.
my dad and my gf's dad both have their own opinons on things.
yes. i also don't feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it.
no but near him and take care of him.
that is good and bad. i think it is good to talk about though i do feel a little better thank you.
ok thank you very much. i think this is a good stopping point, so thank you for your help.
effects of the pandemic
well, right now my city is undergoing a second wave and it was doing very well so far, but in the past two weeks, have been a slow and steady surge of daily cases. just feeling stress and fear from the second wave..
yeah it's crazy. i am starting to feel paranoid and stressed everytime i go out for groceries. i work once or twice a week outside of the home and i generally get groceries once every two weeks, but my guard is up again, ever since the first wave was gone by the end of summer.. i am also sorry to hear that you have stress from this. i sympathize fully.
thank you for the positive message and believing in me.
grocery pick - up, that's not a bad coping mechanism. i don't know, i don't want to spend the extra money for the special handling though, plus i just feel paranoid having someone touch my groceries. but that's just me.. sanitizer i should probably get, just a disposable one to keep on me at all times..
yes that would help i suppose, just that i stopped going out, to the gym, movies, anything frivolous ever since the pandemic started..
my life was put on a pause and i still can't believe it's november already..
ok, i will look into the grocery method.
so literally, i only go out for a purpose, meaning special errands like groceries and personal administrative tasks, banking, work, and only that.. work life, let me think. i only started a new work in september, and it's not much ( about two days a week ), so i can't comment too much about that. it is stressful seeing more people than usual outside of my home and in such close quarters.
so i get nervous in general when i am at work but i do my work just the same. may not be able to work as well because i have to breathe through a mask, and some other small difficulties.
thank you for all the positive messages so far and in understanding and sympathizing with me..
pretty much. if anything, it's my academic life at home that has changed not so well..
yes, i take online courses and i tend to procrastinate a lot more and get distracted as i find myself more and more at home. just getting carried away and now have impending deadlines.. i can get through it but it has had a toll on my productivity.. i was just taking my sweet time with it and that wasn't good.
because prior to the pandemic, i was pretty regimented with set schedules and can clear my mind with work - outs and going to the gym and movies, but now it's not that simple..
thank you and i hope your schooling goes well also..
yeah i like your idea of dedicating the time. i find that i am slacking off and being disorganized in areas like time management. so yes i have to improve on that.. i suppose you have been doing your schooling relatively better in your situation?. i hope you do anyhow.
would you have any other advice on how to overcome things like time management with academics? like how to avoid procrastination? because this was so much better in the past that i just had set schedules and can clear my mind by going out, etc.. and feeling refreshed and feeling the urgency to study again.. but that's gone for me now..
great, i think that's a good area for me to go into.. timers and set agendas.
like a timetable when they used to hand out when i used to be in high school, let's say. and this hour i do this, etc.. and as you say, yoga or work out in between. all great ideas i think.
thank you for that.. ok then. i think i am set now to get back to my studies then with a refreshed mind..
thank you for all your help. you as well and i hope your studies and work go well.. have a great day also.
i am qualified for a promotion but my boss won't promote me
yes that's right. it's frustratgn. * frustrating.
unfortunately i can't really talk to anyone at work because there is no one i trust to this extent. promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue.
the hr department favours managers so i am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further.
thanks, that's good to hear.
it's hard to be positive when i feel like my manager is not receptive to my opinions and just trusts the feedback given by this one other person.
maybe it is time for me to start looking elsewhere for better opportunities. i've worked at this place so long that i have become comfortable here and the thought of searching for a new job is intimidating.
yeah i agree, it's uncomfortable and difficult though! i haven't searched for a new job in so long, i feel like i will perform terribly at the interviews.
it has, thanks for being supportive and listening to my problem.
i experience sleepless nights so frequently since i lost my best friend due to covid 19. i keep on having memories we had growing up together. when i think about this things i cannot sleep sometimes for an entire night.
am ok but feeling sad and anxious.
yes. i recently lost my childhood best friend to covid 19.
sure. i feel so lonely sometimes because we were very close.
yes we have mutual friends. i do reach out to them sometimes. but the feeling doesn't go away. it makes me have sleepless nights. i can't sleep. every time i close my eyes i see him very close to me like we are having conversations.
i hope so too. and i hope he is a better place. have you ever lost someone close to you?
sorry to hear that..
i will try to do that. how can i handle this sleepless nights?
sounds like stuff i can try out. i have a strong attachment to my phone. will be a tough one to try leaving it off while i try to get some sleep.
good thoughts there. will definitely try out the tips. i feel better already just talking to you. thank you, bye.
in the last year i have been dealing with chronic health issues as well as have covid-19 shut everything down. i feel like my life has come to a complete stop and there is nothing to look forward to anymore.
november before covid started i was diagnoses with crps ( its a nerve issue that causes immense pain ) and had to stop doing my activities like dance, then when covid hit last march and we all had to isolate i have not been able to interact with people outside my immediate family.
yes that is correct.
i know i'm not alone and that's what makes it hard to reach out, because i don't want people to think that i think my problems are worse then there's. it just seems like everyone was happy to find different ways to stay in touch when the lockdown all first started but the longer it goes on the less everyone seems to be trying to connect.
i just don't know what to do about it anymore. yes, i don't like to bother others or let other people down.
i'd be open to doing yoga once things open back up, but having this disease puts me in a high risk category so my interaction outside the home still has to remain limited until we develop some heard immunity.
i did take walks along the path in our development last summer so the cabin fever wasn't as bad as it seems to be with all the snow that basically kept me inside all of february.
the local fb group is only full of everyone complaining about everyone else ( seems when everyone is home things seem to get on peoples nerves more so then when people could get away from home consistently ) but i've never heard of the app neighbors, i'll have to look into that.
i will definitely have to look into that.
getting someone else's perspective helps because like you recommending that app, there are things i don't know about out there so i appreciate that.
you did thank you, and i hope you have a good day and a great weekend and stay safe yourself!
i cannot paint at art school
uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas.
not confused. frustrated that i have to produce art for marks when i am not inspired.
painting after painting. like i am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for a's.
what is life but a stage. art is life. i love art.. no.
does the sun now set and then rise again. does the spring not come after winter. yet i cannot see how art will give me grades.
yes, but no like a 9 - 5 job. perhaps i am yet another art failure. art has no time.
you speak the truth. i will again pick up my brush and see where my inspiration takes me. oh it has been a joy talking to you.
i broke up with my partner prior to this pandemic. i've been feeling lonely ever since.
not good. you?
good to hear. been feeling lonely due to this pandemic.
do you mean physical or ebooks?
any genres you would suggest?
oh ok. i was thinking about getting a dog, is that a good idea?
do you have any dogs?
oh ok. there is a lock down from where i live, how about you?
when do you think things will go back to normal?
the holiday season has me down
the season has me down. no family around.
trying to work and write but lack motivation.
i don't talk to anyone.
i live in a hotel currently. no family or friends around, especially with the virus.
i am a writer. witht he virus it is hard to meet anyone. i am only here until next week then i have to go to virignia. my children r all over the country.
i try the dating sites, but they seem to far away or impersonal. hope things are better. just the current season ahs me down.
no verbal communication makes it hard.
i try but the loneliness is the hard part.
it is just the lack of communication.
without any communication it makes it seem like a battle alone. my daughter is busy and 3 hours away. different time zones amke it hard.
children can only share so much. i chat with her, but the timing is off.
find a place to live for awhile. i have to take care of a legal matter.
i just want a person to chat with that we can share with each other. children r ok to chat with but lack of a female to spend time with is hard.
unfortunately the virus stopping people.
ok well thanks for the chat. i will let you go. be blessed.
i recently split up with my boyfriend and i am regretting it.
i'm feeling really down about my breakup.
yes. i thought that it wouldn't be terrible because i initiated it but now i regret it.
i'm mainly doubting my decision and i know there's nothing i can do about it.
i did it because i'm trying to focus on self - improvement but looking back now, there's no reason i couldn't have improved myself with my partner.
that's what i hope for. i just can't get over missing my partner because they were great to me, i just needed to be alone.
i did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup. we were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. we haven't really talked since then. the problem is i'm open to something in the future but i don't know that they are and i can't find the courage to ask.
i think i can do that. they needed space because it was hard going from being in a relationship to being friends in a matter of days. i guess i'll just have to continue working on myself and see how things go.
i like that idea. thank you for your help!
my friend is not treating me the way that a friend is supposed to be treating me
sometimes she is very friendly, but sometimes she is super rude. in a way that is so rude that it has never happened before by someone who i consider a friend.
as nice as she is, every once in a while show will be equally nasty.
super snarky comments. yes i have tried. but it still continues.
i can't she is a colleague. so unless i want to get a new job. but she is super helpful and nice 99 percent of the time. and when i have spoken with her, the last time i was very clear with her that it was inappropriate, and it hasn't been happening as often, but the whole situation is still very hurtful.
yes, i have heard these complaints from one other person. do you have any ideas or other suggestions for me.
that is a good idea to talk to a manager. but there is no avoiding working with her because of the nature of my job. but that is an option that i didn't considerr before so thatnk you for your insight. thank you that is very nice. let me know if you have any other ideas as well.
did you try other things as well.
oh that is good, sometimes when a person sees that they are not getting under your skin they give up on pushing your buttons, was that what happened in your case.
how long did it take from starting to ending. the issues.
i have caught my bf cheating on me with his best friend that he told me not to worry about
hi.
not too good sadly : /
my and my long term boyfriend just ended. turns out he was cheating on me for the past 3 months with his best friend : (
tell me about! we were planning on moving in together next year.
i noticed a few signs and confronted him about it. he didn’t even deny it! he wasn’t remorseful at all... it’s like he doesn’t even love me. how can you love someone yet betray the, somquiclu. so quickly * *
not at all.
yes he admitted it.
we were together for 3 years. i don’t know how he could just toss it down the drain.
no, that’s why i’m talking to u. i haven’t been able to eat or sleep in a few days.
no he was my everything.
i know.. it’s hard when everything reminds me of him.
are righ... it just sucks i have to start all over again.
my friend suddenly stopped talking to me and i do not know the reason
not good, i am very sad.
my friend just stopped talking to me and she won't tell me the reason why.
she stopped communicating completely. doesn't even reply to me texts.
yes, just this past week. how did you deal with your situation?
exactly. do you know of any online resources that one can use to get through such situations?
the other areas of my life are doing good. just that the sadness is getting to me at times.
the other relationships are good even though i'm now more wary of people because i don't know who could leave my life at any moment without notice.
yes it doesn't. but still, you never know who to trust anymore.
no i don't. please tell me about him.
will check her out immediately. infact, let me do that now.
ongoing anxiety about small things but seem to be much bigger in my head.
much better than normal, even though the stock market is down.
i am a student that tries to put as much money into as possible.
no the stock market really doesn't cause stress for me, mostly just small things that i think my brain overreacts to.
kind of a variety of things. i typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. so i am trying to cut out drinking.
sometimes but i think the root from them comes from when i do something while i'm drinking. not that i do anything bad, but i just don't like not remembering things.
i used to black out a lot, but i have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks i consumed in half, if i do choose to go out.
it is typically the amount i'm drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most.
they don't necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but i do have to tell them i'm not gonna go out for the night.
yes after one or two statements they give up..
thanks for the ideas and the help, have a good day.
quitting my job last year because of mental healthy
just life, bad year.
yes it has, the political turmoil in the united states is very scary as well. i am self employed. but not working alot.
i am a writer.
mostly sights that talk about movies. there are a few i submit to.
oh yes i know that one.
that is cool. a good way to discover other writers as well. i wish, that would be good money. i'm horrible at doing things for others, i need people to pay me to do my thing..
awesome, good for you.
oh, i dont use it much.
on linkedin? really?. are you a machine?
yes i know of patreon.
lol amazing.
actually i am, at least a little bit. i have a pacemaker.
same.
as far as i know.
neat, i've experienced a lot in my life.
i write short stories a lot.
when i met myb coworkers in job and they have not done has we had agreed, i get bored and irritated the whole day with negative mood due to the dissapointment they did not met the requirements we had set to attain by set date aside

i recently lost my job due to a disability. i have not been able to get another job.
cold and snowy here.
pa.
no. i was hurt at work.
yep.
yeah. i went to court due to it but they sided with the employer so i lost my job.
which?
i have permanent spinal injuries.
hopefully vaccine is avail soon.
yeah they paid a dr to say i wasn't injured.
i applied for disability but didn't get it.
yes. had my own dr stating i was injured but it didn't matter.
i'm not injured enough for them.
i tried but since it is the state of pa they have immunity. no.
i was told that i assumed the risk of injury working for them. it was a mental hospital.
not yet. i should.
the lawyer fought with them for over a year. there was even an appeal but i lost that too.
yes.
yes.
i can't go after the patient because they are mentally incompetent so i'm out of ideas.
i don't know if the person had one anymore.
yes.
he was placed there by the court after committing a crime.
oh i agree. there were many dangerous patients there and no recourse for the staff. i was injured 5 times in the years i worked there. this last one was the end for me. i couldn't work anymore due to pain.
i have been applying for those kind of jobs but haven't had any luck yet.
i have just cheated on my girlfriend.i feel very guilty about it
feeling very shame.
i have cheated on my girlfriend.
me and my girlfriend mom had an physical relationship but till now my girlfriend belives im good guy.
what should i do now.
i have gone to her home. her mom taken advantage to me what should i dothat time so we did it.
but till now my girlfriend dont know about it but her mom is now targeting me for her sexual desire.
but think about her mom how could i handle her.
yes im going to warn her.
yeah i can understand.
give any tips to warn her my friend.
my boss reduced my pay so that he gets a bonus
it's been a pretty crazy year. i'm mostly bummed because of my work.
sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else's pay by 10 %... i was bummed but i kind of understood because i knew our business would be impacted by closures. i found out recently that my boss ( the vp ) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year.
haha i don't know... i'm sure someone has... heck the vp is getting a bonus... so i'm sure he'd say he's having a good year.
amen.. that's a good call, i've got a work buddy who i feel somewhat comfortable talking with. i may try and reach out to him.
i agree and i think you're right. i appreciate you chatting with me about this.
trapped in a house with my brother which i can not afford to get out of.
currently, i am living in a house with my brother, which i co own and can not afford to move out..
yes it is. he acts like a azz most of the time. he dosent care about anyone but himself. just like his fiancé. he throws away the bills and expects me to pay to keep the utilities on when they are about to be disconnected. then tells me i dont contribute to the house..
yes, felling very stuck..
trying to, looking for every way possible to make money and save it up and move out. really dont want to have to partition the property as its the house we grew up in..
i tried to talk to him, in his mind its all my fault he cant pay the bills he had before i moved in. i had been living in california for the last few years, but came back with corona virus on the rise there..
right? and his fiancé is the same way, they are both alcoholics and spend most of their income on their habits. its all i can do right now to keep food in the house, let alone running water..
i have a couple of friends that i have talked to about it, but it just seems like i am screaming at a brick wall and nothing changes..
police are a very bad idea where i live. they will not prosecute family violence without also prosecuting me. i live in texas, if i press charges, the state will press charges against me. i have several scars from incidents where they told me as such. its really a loosing battle where the law is concerned here..
thank you for listening tho. it is nice to talk to someone outside of my normal circle about these things. : )
current partner cheated on me in the past and i think he is doing it again.
i am having such a difficult time today!!!
i think that my boyfriend is cheating on me again!!!
he has but it was a long time ago and was before we had a talk about exclusivity in our relationship but it still hurt.
we tried counselling once.. it was online and we got paid to do it.. i don't think he took it seriously at the time. he always said he felt like he was being attacked.
yes. i feel he thinks of me as some sort of trophy and he does not have to work now that he won me over in the first place.
i have been as well but this time was supposed to be different. at first everything was great but now things are so distant i just don't know what to do next.
that is true. but now we have a kid together and i feel like it would break her heart to lose her dad.
maybe but a place that we won't get paid to go... i think he thought of it as a job or something. i got a lot out of the experience and still use the skills to this day. but with a unresponsive partner those skills will not work.. can you recomend a good site to find affordable services?
that is a great idea i had not thought of asking my dr.
absolutely best advice i have gotten in a while. it was nice talking to you.
due to covid-19 i can not focus on studies and can't fine help
online learning is not seems easy, seems i am going to fail this year.
in - class learning was way better and i learned a lot but now its so confusing.
even working with online tools is hard.
i know but what is i loose a whole year in academic,.
but i have been in low grades continuously during my last semesters.
well it is still hard to understand online learning tools.
and my internet sometime screws up when i am submitting the assignments. i tried that but i am not tech savy.
due to social distancing i am not meeting with many people. but thanks for talking to me it gives me lot of hope. i shall try to learn from youtube more maybe that is the only solution for online learning.
i work for a delivery company and this client accuse saying that i did not delivered his order
not so good. how are you doing?
yes. well today i had a delivery order. so i went to mcdonald's and pick up the order and took it to the right address and after a few hours i notice that the client did not confirm the order.
five minutes later my supervisor called me saying that the client call and reported that he did not received his order. and that's not true at all, i gave him the food. so now i don't know if they going to fired me or let me keep the job.
of course i did. he told me he going to give me the benefit of the doubt but that is not enough. im an honest person and this kind of accusation makes me feel very bad.
yes. but stuff like that makes me look bad and makes people dont trust me. sure. that can help. i would appreciate it.
well. i normally take pictures of every delivery i make but i let this pass and look what happened.
yes. it won't happen again for sure. this makes me dont trust people again. well. this is the first time i ever faced this kind of problem at work.
i know but sometimes one small thing can hurt you and ruined the reputation that you had build for a long time.
yes. i guess so. you are right. i just going to move on and do my things. thank you very much for taking your time and encouraging me with your words.
yes you did. god bless you and have a good one.
my ex-partner told me yesterday that after being engaged for almost a year, he no longer wants to marry me and he moved out.
i'm really depressed. my fiance left me yesterday.
yes, i think that might make me feel better. i really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn't like him so they think this is for the best.
i just don't understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave.
yes, i feel very betrayed..
they think i should just get over it because they didn't like him so they think i shouldn't like him either. they're making things worse for me.
he left yesterday. i had no warning. he just packed up all his stuff and said he didn't want to marry me and the last year has been a lie.
i'm sorry to hear that. how long did it take you to feel better?
what did you do to help feel better >
i think it's harder that it's during the holidays because i don't go back to work until after the new year. i thought we would be spending the next week together at home.
hopefully. i could really use to sit down with a friend right now and spend some quality time. i don't want to be alone all week.
thanks for chatting with me. i feel a little more relaxed now.
covid-19 has made me more depressed i miss being outside, traveling, hanging with my friends and be happy.
i am ok so far.
i am depressed. and need some inspiration.
covid - 19. and money issues.
my mom and sister had caught the virus they are doing ok now but it was rough.
yeah me too.
yeah mostly working and meditation.
i mostly do it sporadically but i do need to do it more often.
so true.
i like that thank you for the tip i must use that more often.
no that will be thanx for listening to me.
i have been dating this guy for 3 years and i'm tired of where our relationship is at the moment. i had expected him to propose long before now and since he hasn't i have chosen to call it quits as i'm no longer getting young and so afraid of wasting time with him.
i'm doing well, but it could have been better.
yes, my boy friend of 3 years has refused to take our relationship to the next level and i'm kind of getting tired, i don't want to play games anymore.
exactly, i hate to feel that i'm wasting my time.
yes, i love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn't want that for me i would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run..
yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, i don't want it to look like i'm pushing him if i try to talk to him again about it. his nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, i'm just not happy.
i hope you are right, just don't want to come across as a desperate person and that's why i'm setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time.
thanks, it was nice chatting with you.
i find it hard to get motivated, i suffer from low mood and don't know how to get out of this.
i am suffering from low mood and general depression. i don't know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down ( obviously ) and there doesn't appear to be any real reason behind it.
i felt this way for a while actually isn't a recent change it's been building slowly over time.
i think i know what you mean. it's getting worse. i feel very down.
yeah. i worry that i'll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. i'm really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest.
any suggestions on what to do about it?
ok well there is definitely a problem.
not really i don't want to bother other people with my problems.
yeah maybe. i suppose nobody really understands but i could at least speak to them about it.
i don't want to feel like this anymore. i'm willing to at least give it a go.
i haven't spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear i don't want any medication.
yes that's right i don't want to take any pills or anything like that.
ok thanks for explaining. i think i'll speak to my sister about this. if this doesn't help i'll look into making an appointment with the psychologist maybe..
thanks for that.
basically the loneliness of the season and being forced to seclude because of the virus.
good evening.
yes as well as the virus. are we out of time.
just no family around.
are you affected by the virus.
i thought about he videos but my daughter lives in california.
i have to arrange with her because she does not i am moving. it will bother her.
i am having a hard time sleeping due to being nervous about the future
thank you. i've lost my job and i'm very nervous about the future. as a result i am having a hard time sleeping.
that makes me feel a lot better. have you ever lost your job?
what helped you get through it?
i am a gig worker, so i cannot apply for iu. its very hard, but i also have some savings. what kind of tools would you recommend i use to get through this.
wow you're so helpful and encouraging! it's very nice to talk to you.. are there any meds you can recommend to help me sleep?
wow! i've never used melatonin before. did it really help you? are you doing much better now?
i'll look into it. there's a lot of services in the general area that might be able to help me. it's been really nice talking to you.
no i'm okay. i think that's everything : )
you too : ) thanks < 3.
i have found out that my friends have been socialising behind my back without me. this makes me very sad.
i feel that my friends do not like me very much any more. apparently they have been engaging in group activities without me.
do you think that i am over - reacting? i do not want to sound over sensitive but this has been happening for a while.
we went out for coffee the other day and i thought about saying something cos i know they went to a club without me last weekend but i couldn't bring myself to in the end.
sometimes in the past i have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. could it be that they just did not think that i wanted to go?.
the thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. i just feel i am no longer a part of the group.
i don't know. i don't want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. sometimes i think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends.
it is making me really depressed and is badly damaging my sense of self worth. i feel as though i am not worth anyone's time.
thank you that is helpful. what if i reach out and they all snub me though?
it's not really so much that my life is hectic. on the contrary, sometimes it feels as though it is rather empty and not having the support of friends does not help with that. anyway i do appreciate your help - you have given me things to think about.
i cant go back to school because we can no longer afford it
good afternnon.
as i stated i had to cut university short and i feel like am going to finish old.
and i feel like school is my best chance to be someone and get out of the life we are in. mid twenties.
oh do you feel like you under achieved like you do better.
oh that sounds great. sometimes i feel like god is my only ally and friend.
yes i have.
i just hope he holds me through this too, i give myself hope that he let this happen for a reason.
wow.
i think i would have given up or asked god what's his purpose with me cause i cant see it. computer engineering and information technology.
i guess so. i pray i get that too, and not give up easily. thank you.
yes i was. but next year am considering part time.
pick up work. i had a scholarship but it got cancelled when my grades dropped a bit.
that's the plan next year. i have 2 more years to go.
i wont though two years seem like forever right now. actually started saving up now for school next year.
i really will. am going to do my best to get my family out of this place and a better life. yea am looking for every possible help i can get. but thank you so much. this was helpful.
my set of friends with include 6 close women are falling apart because of not communicating often and not being physically close to one another. it is really weird how being apart from one another can really change strong relationships. i am still close with everyone but i can not say the same about everyone else. we have all known each other for 25 years and it makes me sad and anxious that when we come out corona it won't be the same. specifically, two of my besties are arguing with each other over a piece of sensitive gossip that was shared outside our group. someone feels betrayed and i want to help them both without taking sides.
friends and our relationships amongst one another. two are arguing and i want to help both. we only can facetime each other because of corona and it is taking a toll among our group.
it has been around 4 months now. it started slowly and now has ramped up to where it's exploding and causing discourse among us all. one of my friends told a secret to another acquaintance outside of our group. my friend is raging over this which she should. trust was broken.
i believe in forgiveness, and the friend that told is very remorseful how do i help them?
the acquaintance knew something of the secret because she had experienced this before. i think my friend was more - so trying to help my other friend, not betray her. she went outside the group but not for spitrful reasons i think.
i want one friend to know that the other was trying to hel and nothurt, but did not think clearly when deciding where to get help from. how do i make her understand this?
thanks! what should i say to her?
i think this can be good because she is a little hot headed. goos advice! i think i will tell everyonr in our circle to fall back and let her come to us when she is ready.
my friends just not having my back and just not pulling their weight when it comes to paying for stuff. for example, they expect me to pay for everything when we go out to dinner or even go to the bar. any type of activity they will be
hello how are you?
i am doing well just dealing with some problems with my friends.
friends not being there for me when i need emotional support. they also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well.
yes that is exactly it. just sucks not having that emotional support.
i have and it seems that they just tell me what i would like to hear! it sucks when i am always there for them when they need me but they cannot do the same.
it's good to know that i am not the only one going through this. what is your advice from experience with this?
my grandma mostly who is an experienced family therapist but she is going through her own stuff as well.
that is definitely helpful. i will look into being more productive and also doing more hobbies around the house to help clear my mind. any hobbies that you do now that really help?
sounds good to me. i will take up building something... maybe turn it into a business as well. thank you for the advice.
i cannot deal with the death of a parent. this was some years ago but still badly affects me.
i have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. it would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse.
he was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia.
i presume you mean now and not not ; ). though i simply am not a believer. it just made me think how meaningless life was..
i do not really know what to do about my feelings. they are not going away.
do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement? i think that what you said there was very wise. maybe it's worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that.
whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, i think that it would hurt more if i had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day.
it is just - very hard. i keep thinking about all the times i disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and i never got to tell him how much i loved him.
i know that he did : ). i had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. he did not get to enjoy his retirement!
yes. i think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun.
that is a really sensible suggestion and it cheers me up to think of it. you have been a really great help to me.
the fact that my job does not take my health seriously
hi, i'm ok. how are you?
that's great. my job refused my request to continue to work from home. so i was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing.
just to make sure i'm wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. which is not enough. there are more and more teachers getting infected and i just feel it a matter of time before it my turn.. i fear that i will bring this home to my family and i will not survive it. i have pre existing conditions.
yes i have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my rheumatologist.
i feel that way too. i was told it for the best interest of the school that i am there i do not have student in my classroom but i'm forced to help out around the school with students and staff. teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. i can't quit because there not much to go into now.
very true. i'm going to keep trying. thanks for talking with me letting out what i feel has made me feel a little better.
it really did help i feel a bit lighter. thank you again.
i'm addicted to marijuana and cannot stop consuming it on a daily basis.
i am doing well. my marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week.
absolutely not. i'm not even in california yet, where i know my usage will explode. it's just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana.
yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user.
it was recently legalized in our state. my wife and i were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. it is a major part of our lives.
one of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. i'm very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially.
it varies, state by state, depending on which party is governing. which you of course have a version of in the uk. mayoral elections were today yeah?
oh, i take it to mean that you are anti - khan? if you feel like you'd need to vote for mayor in london.
jeremy corbyn, no surrender?
you sound like someone i'd like to smoke a spliff with in a moderated manner of course, in relevance to the topic i opened with.
prescriptive grammar is fascism, use whatever words in whatever order you like. ironic given that i just watched my fair lady the other day.
you've got those weird drug shops in the uk, with synthetics and all that.
let me guess - north / eastern uk?
it's a good series but yeah if you don't skew younger demographic wise i could see why you'd avoid it. you more of a last tango in halifax type? don't even watch the circle? only connect?
true that. but, you know. legally.
i hope one day your people find liberation i think you have helped me a lot with my marijuana problem.
yes, have a wonderful evening! goodbye.
every day it's very difficult for me to get started doing anything at all. a lot of times i struggle just to get up and go brush my teeth and i only shower maybe a few times a week.
i feel bad putting this on your shoulders, maybe you can help.
i'm just struggling a lot to find the motivation to do anything at all, even the most basic of things. sometimes i get very intense feelings of sadness and just want to drop everything i'm doing, like i can't do anything more.
yes that's very true, depression is probably hitting people the worst right now.
no i've been fighting depression since i was probably like 12 years old, it first really hit me when i moved from where i was living all my life and lost all my friends and i was terrified. now i'm 29. but covid definitely plays a factor.
so you had the therapy session online with them via webcam or you found them online first then went to see them in person. yeah covid is doing damage in more ways than one.
i would have to do it in person, i don't want people i live with to hear about all my pathetic mental problems. oh 7 cups, i had an account there and met a really nice girl there that was helping me and she was living with an abusive family at the same time, its crazy but now i can't access that account anymore, i'm so sad about that. i think it says the account doesn't exist when i try to login now.
yeah definitely, i should try contacting their support to try and restore my account.
yeah, i gotta do therapy thats a must and i think it has to be in person so i can try to let some of it out with someone face to face....... but that's going to be very hard, to trust someone and open up about everything because its not just depression. online is convenient but its just too much going on.
right...
ah i don't know it's too much, i don't want to make this hours long. but thank you for talking a little bit about it with me and sharing those resources. hopefully i can find a'natural'way to fix these things without taking meds that might change who i am for the worst or something. hope you have a nice night and stay healthy, you and your family.
thanks, you too, bye.
i just was told that i ma out of a job as of january 15th. i am going to get paid for those two weeks in january that i won't be with the company.
yes. i am in a crisis at my job.
i have been told so. january 15th is my last day.
i will get pay for the last two weeks of january, 2021.
what do you suppose i do? looks like the company has been hot hard by covid - 19 lockdowns.
i am very sad about this country and my work situation. for 5 years. i work in accounting.
yeah, i have not told my wife about it just yet.
yeah, i am not sure. i better wait to break the news in 2021.
and i am not the only one who is losing my job. seems that all of accounting is going to be getting the axe. it makes me sad....
plus, i have a 50 dollar a day spending habit on lottery tickets to one day hit it big. yes, i have a resume that i have not updated just yet. i have a college education and a cpa to boot, but i need one lucky break in life.
maybe i can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing i will be out of a job as of 01 / 15 / 2021. it is almost christmas, too.
maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two bmw's. we spend lavishly.... plus, i spend 50 dollars a day on lotto.
true, but the office was my home away from home. i need to figure out how to deal with my sadness.....
unemployment doesn't last forever ; plus, i have pride in my work. americans are suppose to be strong.
any other suggestions? i was thinking about becoming an uber and lyft driver. the happiness wears off, however.
well, thanks for your input. i think this chat has been helpful. i am a proud american! good bye.
i am so mad that my boyfriend broke up with me because i cheated on him once. he has cheated on me many times and i never broke up with him.
well, my boyfriend has cheated so many times that i cant count them. i then meet someone nice and cheat on him once and now he breaks up with me.
thank you! i can see that i am talking to someone who understands. i am wondering if i should beg him back?? i really do love him.
yeah, and we have been together since high school so it is really hard to think of ever marrying anyone else. he asked me to marry him but we never made it official or got rings.
he told me he never wants kids with me but acts like he would have them someday, somehow? i think you're right.
noway! that is my worst nightmare, i am so sorry. that is a real eye opener for me / that is exactly what i don't think i could handle. i just am in the worst cycle ever and don't have any friends to turn to or anybody who wants to listen to the drama. i think i have wasted a lot of my life and i can't ever get the time back that i have invested in him.
yeah, i can see your point. it is nice being able to vent to you and feel like i am being heard. i never got that in my relationship with him. i need to learn from the past this time and stop repeating it.
i haven't even had the time to get myself cute and fixed up in forever! i love that idea! i need to get my haircut.
no, i have idea?
haha!! yes!! i was thinking the exact same thing! the best revenge is moving on and looking good and with somebody hot!
i really like this man. he was attractive and spoiled me. i thought it was going to work out. then i found out from another friend he found another woman to have sex with. it hurt me a lot!
i met a handsome intelligent man.
we dated for a month. then out of nowhere he cheated on me. i'm so sad. i am just trying to understand what i did wrong.
that's true. it's crazy we have to experience heart ache. to learn...
hey, that is great advice!
i was happy. but when a man breaks your heart, it makes you feel very ugly.
sure, i love going to the movies! how about you!
same.
yes, thank you for the great advice! like thanksgiving, i hope you have wonderful memories with your friends and family next week.
you are very welcomed!
i lost my job and cant find another one
i am not happy. i lost my job.
about 4 months ago.
bus driver and / or production.
that is what i did do but with union rules and bidding rights. there is not enough work.
i tried but my cat is not new enough for their rules.
god has been my source of comfort he's my everything!
i am not so sad not. i will look for other suggestion you gave me. i cannot get unemployment because i only worked part - time.
i can't fall asleep as my mind races at night
i am having such a hard time falling asleep at night.... i toss and turn and cannot shut my mind off.
yes that's right. my mind just races thinking about problems it seems. i am irritable and frustrated.
i worry about my daughter, she has addictions. i never know if she is okay or not, she doesn't call me very often and is hard to get a hold of.
have you any suggestions to help me get to sleep easier? i have tried meditation, but it doesn't seem to help much.
that's a good idea i can try that. my bedtimes are kind of mixed up, maybe setting a particular schedule will help, i'll try that. sometimes i go to be early, sometimes late, maybe that is screwing me up.
good idea, i could try that.
oh ok, that makes sense. i wish my daughter lived closer so i can check on her, she is in another city which makes it hard. i worry. ok well thankyou for your help.
thank you i apprecaite that, to you as well.
masters degree
stressed.
work, kids, school.
how many kids do you have? what kind of degree do you have?
6 year old twin boys and an 8 year old daughter. i'm divorced. they sleep at his house and he gets them off the bus. i start work at 6 so i cna get off at 2 and get them off the bus at 3. i'm going for my master's degree. i am about halfway done.
im so tired all the time. i feel lik everything i do just isnt enough. how do you handle things and stress?
i guess.
i wish i had time lol.
i have struggled with depression for a while but recently it seems to be getting worse, with no clear reason.
hello there. i'm suffering with increased depression and i'm not quite clear why.
no not really. i have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. the only thing that is different these days is lockdown. i think that's the same for everyone.
i saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. i've always had a low mood but now i'm anxious that it will continue to get worse.
since lockdown haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. at the start it was fine, i was feeling just as i always have but i don't want this to get any worse. what if she isn't available?.
what like support groups etc? i'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. it's weird and a little concerning to be honest.
i hadn't thought of that. i know there are a few of these nowadays.
i'll start a plan and seeing if i can see my usual therapist and go from there. sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. do you have any experience with mental health issues?.
that must have been difficult to deal with. mental health affects so many people in so many ways. it's good that it's recognised these days at least.
i think this is why it's always best to see a professional. i really should try to reconnect with mine.
thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective.
i have several exams coming up but have been overwhelmed with virtual classes. my living environment isn't great, with lots of roommates, and i've found it really hard to study.
i'm really stressed with school exams. and i'm struggling with anxiety.
i have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they're all really important for my final grade. i know i'm going to badly because i haven't been learning well during the pandemic.
probably 4. my roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, i can't make any progress studying.
i guess so. but if i fail or do badly on my exams it's really not going to be good. i'm on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3. 0 gpa.
they're the biggest problem right now. but i think having to learn from home is the main problem. it's so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. no library, no office hours, no study groups.
are you a student too?
yeah, i wish the professors and university would be more flexible. when the pandemic first started, we didn't have grades, and that was really helpful.
yeah, even though nothing has really changed. i feel like until way more people get the vaccine, we're still in the pandemic.
thanks for that suggestion. i have tried, but they are immature and just want to party. i've started staying in my room which helps, but is very isolating. i wish i could afford my own place.
me and my girlfriend got into a fight over holiday break that i thought could be fixed but instead ended up in us breaking up
yes, so we had a fight previously over thanksgiving break about how i woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. then i pick her up to go try and get breakfast... then she starts punching me while i drive so i pull over. then she keeps hitting me until i tell her to stop.
it is because i do really miss her. i really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up.
yeah she was a little violent. i was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes.
we have talked a little bit before hand this month. it was okay but i am still sad about what happened. she was very open to talking and such but i just wasn't ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety.
i know but i am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. i still keep on thinking about her.
i will definitely try to get over her using those techniques you just said. it's way harder to do than say though. no, this is not my first breakup with a woman but i felt like she was the one for me.
maybe you're right! just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent.
i will definitely try. i know it will be hard because i am upset still but sometimes i guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation.
awww i hope so. just like some people say... there are plenty of fish in the sea. thank you for the advice. it was really helpful.
my best friend used to call me all the time (many times per day) and we would talk for hours. it's been three days and i haven't got a text, a call, nothing. she just moved into a new home and i understand she is busy, but i feel ignored.
good afternoon to you.
yes, my best friend has decided that i'm not that important... or as important as i thought i was....
she used to call me multiple times per day, it's been 3 days and nothing.
yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends.
absolutely... what do you think is wrong?
i'm not sure, i don't think i have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven't had a fight.
well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn't even want me to help her, no she doesn't work.
well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? she lives with her husband.
a week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday.
hmm, no i didn't think about that, that may be a good idea.
yes, but the home came furnished and honestly, i didn't think there was that much to do, but maybe i should get a gift, to break the ice.
yes, it is very important, i just felt if i called i would be bothering her : (
that is possible, and it is a huge house, 4 stories.
no, we are not seeing each other in person due to covid. do you think i should try calling or texting first?
yes, they certainly do, darn covid stops everything.
would a text be more appropriate vs. a phone call? what do you think?
i just feel so hurt and abandoned, like i don't mean anything to her.
well, i think i will try that, i mean, it's not that intrusive. i hope she's not feeling alone, i hope she doesn't think i'm abandoning her!
i am going to send her a message, do you think i should get her a digital gift card as a gift? yes, she has a son in college.
i think i will text her and let her know i'm sending a gift card.... maybe she will respond.
that's a great idea! thank you : )
lost my job and unable to find the new on
not feeling good. trying to find a job but no success.
i am getting unemployment but that is not sufficient with 6 children.
as a single mother it's pretty hard to go to search for food bank. i am spending most of my time in looking for a job.
i don't know any as i never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable.
one of my friends was really helpful. she moved to different city last month. after that i am totally shattered.
life is becoming hard day by day. i am feeling guilty that i can't feed my kids well. no one wants to do friendship with poor people.
thank you so much for all your support. you will be a great person for sure. i would like to be your friend but i have nothing to return.
i would try to search near by food bank or ngos as you suggested. thank you so much for all you help.
your words are motivational and it gave me positivity to move forward.
i found out my girlfriend was cheating on me thru text. i caught her typing to a another guy.
hi. could you please help?.
i am okay.
i caught my gf texting another guy.
yes right.
asking about what he was doing later. what he likes to do for fun.
yes for sure, i was so shocked and disappointed.
oh no! thats horrible too.
thanks so much! i think i can too. thanks for sharing with me.
no i feel like she should come to me about it since she was caught.
i saw her do it. she didn't really say a whole lot, she just left right afterwards.
that's probably true, just a bit awkward.
thanks for being supportive. relationships are tough.
no i think i am good. thank you again!
my ex-boyfriend broke up with me because i was too jealous and i didn't trust him
i'm sad.
my ex - boyfriend broke up with me.
because i didn't trust him and i was always jelous.
yes, i think so, because i should not feel like that, i should trust him.
yes, it's true. thanks for the information. i'm trying not to talk to him or think about him, because i feel better.
but it's so hard do to that. i spend a lot of time with him.
yes. i'll do it.
yes, i'm going to do that.
yes, it's true. for now, i'll just cry and sleep.
yes, thank you. bye.
husband left me for someone else.
well, my husband of 25 years left me last week. my life is done now.
well, i cannot say it is a new start when i will be 90 in march.
had.
he wanted a younger woman. his new girlfriend is 63. he is 45.
i thought it would be nice to have a younger man when we got married. he eventually told me he just married me for my money, and was waiting for me to pass so he could inherit all of it. he said he got tired of waiting, so he moved on to someone else.
now i am here alone.
i am looking on tinder for a new friend, but nobody wants someone that is 90. i never used it before, but someone told me about it. considering i haven't dated in 25 years.
what are those? i heard of them, but never used them. most of my old friends are no longer around...
i am looking for something quicker, i don't know how much longer i have. i can't be spending months waiting for the right person.
well.... someone to spend time with. my great grandson said people meet others on tinder now. told me i should try it. have you heard of it or used it?
my best friend's son died in a car accident.
hello, thank you for signing up to listen to me. i could be better but thank you for asking.
i am upset about the loss of my best friend's son dying in a car accident.
the accident was thursday february 25th but he held on until sunday the 28th. he was only 26 years old.
i understand what you are saying but that's the problem. how to deal with such a terrible unexpected loss. i feel helpless because there is nothing i can do to make her feel better.
she is inconsolable..... and me also being upset is not helping matters either. you are exactly right... it's impossible to help. that is great advice... thank you. i really appreciate you taking the time to listen.
i actually feel a little better. i will just sit with her and keep her company and be there to listen. i'm glad i accepted this survey today. enjoy the rest of your day and thank you again!
i know we are in a pandemic. i have a family member who can't get approval for unemployment after he was laid off from his part-time restaurant job. he keeps getting denied and all the politicians do is fight back and forth.
the unemployment office is overwhelmed and i'm overwhelmed trying to help my family member.
yes, it just very frustrating. my family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, covid. they have been going to temp services also.
the job center's can only help so much. and if they don't have internet skills, then online jobs will help.
so this family member gave up their apartment, moved back in with family, still fighting unemployment and going to food banks. it's crazy. they are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it's hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess.
no online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training.
yes, there is more to life than money. unfortunately $ is needed for the basics. thanks for listening and guidance.
yes and i wish you a good thanksgiving holiday.
i fear that i might never be loved again. i feel so lonely.
hi. i'm feeling okayish.
absolutely. i recently broke up with my girlfriend. we had been together for more than 3 years.
she said that she simply wasn't in love anymore, and that she didn't have the same feelings she did at the beginning.
she was so important for me. i feel so empty.... i feel like i'm never finding anyone like her ever again,
it's easier said than done. at times i would rather maybe just dissapear. i have never had anyone else show romantic interest in me before.
i am 25 at the moment.
i disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. i don't think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. i was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman i meet.
i think she wasn't feeling physically attracted to me anymore.
actually, in the past few months she has kinda freaked out everytime i tried to get her phone for her. as if she didn't want me to see something.
i can't believe she would do something like that... i really need to confront her about it. i can't have this doubt on my chest.
you are right. i need to take this slowly and calmly.
loss of job and the pandemic
doing ok, thanks.
not a whole lot due to the economic hardship my family and i are facing. how about you?. as far as holiday plans.
oh i am sorry to hear that.
thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive.
cook a good meal and spend time with my kids and spouse. gifts wont be extravagant this year but i guess its the thought that counts.
totally, thanks for that insight.
very nice, does it snow where you live?
awesome. we are dealing with 60s ourselves. which is not too bad either.
how was your thanksgiving? were you able to invite others or was it just with family? assuming you are in the us somewhere.
its hard for me to find a job
its hard for me to find a job. things could be doing better. it's been a bad week for me.
yea, i got laid off in july. the market has been tough.
thats good. i'm an engineer and i would like to take another engineering role. but they are hard to come by now adays.
yes, i still get some unemployment which helps. i've done many interviews.
yes exactly, i have two young ones. its already hard for them to be at home all day and zoom for school. i just want to make this christmas specia. so its been a bummer with covid going on.
thanks. well i'm going to have to continue looking for jobs on linkedin. thank you for your time.
any other advice to offer me. before i go.
awesome. those are some great ideas. and not cost a lot of money.
i found out an ex friend was talking behind my back to my current friends about me
i'm good. how r u?
i'm not happy with an ex friend who talks behind my back to my current friends.
nope. we are not on speaking terms. we have sued each other in court before. we are past talking.
they're still friends with me. if it gets bad enough i can sue her for slander.
no. i don't want anything to do with her. if i find out my friends take her side they will be my ex friend too.
absolutely not. i have a strong constitution about myself and don't allow to be disrespected by anyone.
i tried to get an order for her to stay away from me. the first judge passed it but the second judge said it wasn't strong enough..
no. she hasn't done anything lately for me to get a court order. if she starts anything again i will get a lawyer and sue her.
absolutely will avoid her. if she ever convinces my friends should i tell them i don't want to associate with them anymore?
yeah exactly. people need to realize who's side to stay on.
it's easier said than done. a lot of people are afraid of being alone and will put up with garbage.
yeah it sucks lol.
thank ya! likewise.
i feel very bad to work on remotely. it sucks me and i cant anage the work life balance on this covid pandamic. it really hard to manage my time with my family and they expect more from us hence we are in work from home.
this work from home tension and cant go out with my family and parties. it makes me depressed and cant bear this pathedic situation.
i am fully occupied with my job. this software field sucks me. even weekends also they are expecting to work with offshore people. i dont find the time to spend with my partner and kids.
yeah! good idea, i ll make a call with my manager once. it could be better to have vacation for a week.
exactly. please suggest me any idea to spend my time with my family and away from this work pressure. sounds good! i ll arrange a conversation with my head then.
absolutely, then i ll help my family with household chores and make them free. then we have some quality time to spend together!
hah hah! it's ok, we can quit this conversation now! thanks once again!! : - )
since i have to practice social distancing and isolate with the pandemic, i have been feeling more depressed. i miss hanging out with my friends and family.
i am having ongoing depression.
i have the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. it first began a couple of weeks ago.
yes, i am sad and anxious about the coronavirus. i miss seeing my friends and family.
yes, definitely. i hope the pandemic will end.
i haven't thought about dying at all. i take medication each day for my depression, but there are times when i still feel sad.
you're welcome. i understand, but i am not suicidal.
i would like to talk about solutions since i feel like the problem is defined.
yes, i enjoy taking walks and doing a cardio workout at home.
i could communicate more with my family by calling them on the phone, texting, emailing, or talking to them on zoom.
wanting to stay in bed is keeping me from using these methods.
i feel okay about that.
yes, it is worth a try. thank you for all of your help!
thank you.
i cheated on my boyfriend and i don't want to tell him. i feel really bad because he is a great person.
yes, thank you! i was with him since childhood and we are actually still together. i slipped up one night and hate to admit what i did.
yes, it is intense guilt. i can't think of anything else. i hate to tell you but i cheated on him. i am so sorry and can't look at myself in the mirror.
i feel like i am worthless and i don't deserve to ever be happy or laugh again. i really do love him and i don't ever want him to find out what i did. yes, i cant stop beating myself up. he doesn't know what i did but he is little suspicious.
thank you! a long time ago his sister told me that he cheated on me and i believed her and so i wanted to get him back.
i appreciate that and have been thinking about character a lot lately. i do believe he cheated on me first, if that even matters now.
yes, i feel very even! i won't do it again. can i ever give up the guilt that i feel and move on in our relationship or do i have to tell him what i did? i have known couples who don't tell each other and they are happy now.
thank you for making me feel heard. i have been alone in my thoughts and needed to be understood. yes, i agree with you and i feel like i kind of let it go now that i told you about it. i am going to be in touch regularly of that's okay? i feel so much better now. i can take a deep breath again and i want to go take a walk with my dog now. thank you for all of your time and understanding.
that sounds great because i want to keep this private and i know you won't tell anyone so i feel really safe here.
my mental health (innatentive adhd) cannot be properly medicated with the recommended medication because of an underlying heart condition. causing a low mood.
hi.
ive been better. stressful day.
long story short, im a recovering alcoholic, 52 days sober, however my mental health has hit me with vengeance and am really struggling day to day.
i used alcohol as a self medication. it helped keep bad symtoms of adhd away. i miss what alcohol used to do for me.
thankyou for allowing me some of your time. i would be so much better if my heart wasnt poorly. i could then be medicated properly. as of now i just have to live with it. kinda sucks.
i feel for your friend.
yes i have a therapist and currently on a 10 week post detox intensive plan to keep me focused. i have a good support network.
i just wish to live outside my own sideways mind for 5 minutes. i need help with not becoming frustrated and angry with myself. cant really see a way forward, am i destined to be absent minded for life? i know there must be a way somewhere to live normally.
i will, i will not stop engaging for many years.
thankyou. its nice to read that.
i have plenty but im sure we dont have the time : ) as for now its just the one issue above, its a big issue but once somehow if i can rectify it i will have so much to offer society. thankyou for your time.
and you. bye bye.
i broke up with my partner and am feeling like i should even commit suiside, i was played a fool
am not fine.
i was cheated on severally, and it resulted me to end the relationship.
yes thats it.
exactly, i can tend to focus because i have given so much time and affection, i never thought i would be called the fool after everything i did.
i want to move on but i dont know how, i tried to but i just cant.
i think you right, maybe i should renew my netflix sub, since i find great interest in movies so as to get some positive vibes and think less of this whole situation.
yh thats true.
thanks, you are a life saver. gotta go now.
i got all i need now. have a nice day ahead.
had an issue with my wife concerning my drinking habits where she complained that i had of late been drinking soo much. there was a confrontation that almost led to a breakup and now we are not talking. the situation is serious
hi, yes am doing well.
i had a drinking challenge which has been affecting my marriage for quit sometime now.
yes that is true.
yes i have really reduced my drinking to ensure i save my marriage.
thank you for the encouragement. will do everything i can to save the situation.
thank you.
any other general advice you may have for me.
wow that is some wonderful advice right there. thank you for that.. any other tips to spice things up.
thank you i will definitely avoid drinking and any thing else that may contribute to such kind of issues.
thank you for the assistance. really appreciates.
i left my job, and moved across the country without another job lined up. it's been 3 months since i have worked. and this is compounded by a lot of feelings of loss and grieving as i left a job of 8 years.
hi. i wasn't sure anyone was there. i left my job about three months after 8 years.. haven't found another one.. trying to find one has been challenging.
well, yeah. in the middle of a pandemic, and being in a new town. all of that has been really hard. and stressful.
yeah... i don't know... i'm not sleeping well because i'm so worried.
thanks for trying to understand. it just seems pretty hopeless.
yeah, i am looking in a variety of fields. not much out there that is remote.
that would be cool. i really enjoy tech.
yes it would.. just don't have much energy to keep turning in cover letters and resumes..
yah thats true. you have any ideas on how to be less anxious.
yeah, stuck is a good description.
i am recently divorced. my ex-husband has moved in with his new, much younger girlfriend and they are discussing marriage. although i am happy the marriage is over, i'm depressed because i have not had any romantic offers while he has moved on with no problem.
hi jonathan, i'm keri.
i'm feeling a little bit down today. i've been feeling a little bit down a lot lately.
my ex - husband is moved in with his new girlfriend. they might get married.
he started dating a few months after we split up. i don't know if this is the only person he's dated but i think so. he really moved on quick. hi, are you still there?
it makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and i don't. i'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good i think, but sometimes i feel really really lonely too. like maybe i won't ever find anyone.
thank you! exactly. but it is scary. i am guessing from your name that you identify as male ( please forgive me if that is incorrect ), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women.
haha, watering my own grass. that is a good way to put it. thank you for talking to me for a few minutes. it makes me feel a little bit better to have someone agree that it is okay to spend time working on me, instead of thinking that it is sad or pathetic or an excuse. i really appreciate it.
have a good night, jonathan. : - )
i broke up with partner, my friend sent me pic of her hubby etc
hello. how are you? i wanted to briefly chat about my jealous feeling. my friend sent me a pic as a greeting showing her hubby and i am jealous.
next time i see her i want to hide my jealous feeling, but not sure if i can do it well. great. i am good.
yes that is correct.
yes.
i could say i am a female that is one of those left out. not currently. i really don't know how those women find partners and get married and stay with the same partner for a long time.
i think so, i am not complaining but i guess i am haha.
i am very sexy and fun but not relaxed, i am caring i think but am not good at showing it. blush!
true true.
oh really! i will definitely try that. great advice. thank you. i hope you have a good xmas. i wish your happiness over chrismas! : )
i have so much credit card debt and don't know how i am going to pay it off
hi i thought you were not going to show. my anxiety level just increased while i was waiting for you.
i am having a panic attack. i have to come up with 100 by next week to meet my minimum charge. on my credit card.
yes it sure is.
yes any suggestion s.
they are swamped with their own bills and we live pay check to pay check.
no i haven't but if i don't pay minimum i will get 24 % interest penalty.
it is the truth thats why i try to pay off in full but there was such a great deal. but thats a great idea and would give me a little extra time. thank you. i think ill go google credit card offers.
no i knew the terms when i signed up a year ago.
i like your idea of transferring to lower interest one.
okay ill go check it out. thank you..
thank you. keep safe and have a good night.
daily stresses
i am well, thanks for asking. i am doing some studying and taking a break now. just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. the big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. and it's the start of the second wave in my city..
yeah it sure has been since march this year for my city.
there's kind of a lag as i am on the east coast. so the cases didn't really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. but we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, i don't know and it just boggles on my mind..
i get that there's a fatigue but i was there and i had that fatigue and i got over that a few months ago late summer when i tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren't any cases then, as the first w ave was gone from my city. i see. yeah i feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. if i can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. if they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then i don't think they should be doing that too much..
it is. and that's sad but true. it's in our nature, as you say. it's in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but i can only cope by doing what i feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others.
yes i agree also. it's hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. i was more affected and more emotional. so i do see that i am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. so hopefully i can stay well mentally.
and yeah, that's the best we can do for now, as you say, is follow the rules and science, and do our part.. ignore the naysayers and compromisers. that's really good. the relaxation technique, i mean.
yeah i take time every now and then off from my studies, but my schedules are not set or consistent, and i procrastinate a lot. so that when i fall behind on a typical day, i try to catch up and end up not having enoug h time to even work out at home, or feel tired and sleepy, when i should have finished with my academic work early in the day. yeah that's good advice. i will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news.
so yeah, just aimless and procrastinate often, and need more self - imposed structure, discipline, maturity, organization, time - management, etc.. yeah good idea. like i am only lately gaining ground and staying on track so i am improving on this. yeah i should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort..
true. my courses are nearly finished anyhow by the end of december. so after that, i will revamp my style in the new year and start anew. anyhow that's all for now. i think you have provided some very valuable advice. and i will keep those in my mind on a daily basis.
applying for work, i have been retired for 2 years and would like to return to the work force.
hello and nice to meet you. i am doing ok. how are you and thank you for your time. my name is jim.
i really appreciate your time yes.
i have been retired for over 2 years and would like to return to the workforce, part - ti me.
yes, it would help us greatly.
there are plenty of jobs and not sure where to start.
thanks what do you mean? yeah, i know this but i don't feel it..
yeah, i am. i know i can do it. not sure where to start.
wow, that's great. how did you start?.
what gave you the strength to go forward? i have this nervousness about getting rejected..
so, keep myself busy and try to ignore my nervousness?
ok, so with, well, kinf0f like baby steps.... right.
build up my confidence and not take things personally.
yeah, so true.
i have a few ideas and go with my strength's and abilities that i have already been successful in the past.
yeah, i like it. i guess i needed to just chat with someone and listen to myself.
true, that is what my wonderful wife tells me and that god has a plan for me. thanks.
that's really true, need to stop feeling sorry for myself. thank you. this has been helpful.
yes, they will. thank you.. this is good. take care and god bless. ty.
i was laid off from my job
i feel lost and lonely, i do not know what to do.
they came about when i lost my job in august of this year.
yes, finances have especially been very tight.
it is, have you ever encountered such a situation in your life?
how did you snap out of the situation, did you have some savings?
yes, i have been researching a lot too but it is difficult given that i have been surviving on the savings i had. also it is very difficult to get a loan currently.
yes, i have two children, 5 and 9 year olds.
that is very helpful of you. i have been wandering all over the internet lost and not knowing where to find help from. i will definitely check this out and make good use of them. did you also get any funds from anyone?
i agree that god is our ultimate guide and helper in all this. he will never forsake us no matter what. i will definitely turn to him at this time to seek for his guidance and with faith he will see me through.
true, you have been very helpful and i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me.
my boyfriend cheated on me and i found out 6 months later at work from a customer. i was so embarrassed. i did not eat for days.
yes. with another woman.
i was told by a customer at work. i do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with. he will not admit it himself.
yes. he says the person who told me is lying. we are not married but we live together.
2 years.
what do you mean exactly?.
i guess all people are different. i generally trust people easily.
that is true. he is but, has been distant lately.
do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous?.
that is a good point..
i am not sure if i am okay with giving him an ultimatum. we are still young and although i love being in a relationship, i am unsure about marriage. but i appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile.
i should trust my partner more than any random person.
but every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. how should i approach him to communicate better?
okay! that is a good idea. maybe i can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together.
that is a good point. it is just hard to go on with the relationship when i feel i do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance.
okay. i will keep that in mind. we are 22.
yes but less over the past few months.
that's understandable. maybe i can communicate with him first.
he is going to law school and i am going to med school. there is a ton of stress on both ends..
no live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. i communicate much more than he does. thats why i think he is hiding something.
you are right. i will try to be more sensitive about that. thank you for your help..
do you think getting other people involved is a good idea?
yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. we both live far away from home.
yes off campus. same college.
i work at a bar part time to support may way through school. it was a women. i know her, but not well. met a few times around school.
my partner left me for another woman after fifteen years and after saying he did not want children with me.
my partner left me after fifteen years and i simply do not know what to do.
things had not been going well for a while but i had not realised just how bad it would be.
about two weeks. i have barely left the house since then. i just do not feel that i can go on.
i think mostly the latter. i just do not want to face the world any more. i feel that everyone must know that i've been dumped and be laughing at me.
i did not really have any choice though. i do not see any future for myself now that we are separated.
no i do not, who is that?
thank you, i will. right now i really need some sort of emotional support. i feel that the last fifteen years of my life have been a waste.
it is not so much that - it is that i feel that i dedicated the majority of my adult life to this relationship and now there is nothing left.
i really do not feel like it right now. what was the last fifteen years all about? i wanted to have children with him and he refused but now i hear he is expecting a baby with another woman.
but it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and i do not know if i even want to.
but i feel that i am facing middle age on my own and i really do not want to do that.
what happens if i just can't ever get over it though? right now it's hard to see any sort of way through these feelings.
i feel i might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because i waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that.
most of my friends seem to be very happily coupled up right now. they are sympathetic but they do not really understand.
that sounds like very good advice from both you and your doctor. it is a difficult thing to have to confront though. i really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to talk honestly with me.
i have been chatting with my boss and he is telling me that my job performance is consistantly low. they want me to move 10 pallets per hour which near almost impossible. this is a well paying job and i'm afraid i will be losing it soon.
the problem with a job like amazon or kehe distribution is the quotas. the pay is extremley well but the work is extremely dangerous and extremely exhausting.
no covid 19 has nothing to do with any of this work.
well when there are 50 million americans out of work right it's a bit scary. i'm a forklift operator..... i move pallets from one area of the warehouse to another but i.
am based on a quota. i am suppose to be able to move 10 pallets per hour. that's almost impossible as it is a 1 million square foot warehouse. if i get a pallet on the west side and have to move it to the east side that takes 7 - 10 minutes even if your going dangerously fast. doesn't feel like it to me.
i feel like a replaceable cog in a giant machine that doesn't give two shits whether i show up for work or not despite having over five years experience with over 12 forklifts..... yes and they always say the same thing. you need to get your numbers up but it's a catch 22 you can't possibly safely get your numbers up and accomplish your quotas.
so.
i am a felon and i have a bachelores degree in business management. i am desperately trying to get out of the quota based work areas.
do you know how incredibly hard it is to serve your time in jail for 3 years and get out and can't find a job except scrubbing floors or cleaning shit or servinge tables. my manager doesn't give a shit.
do what. work at burger king for $ 7. 25 an hour.
i'm not so sure if that's true anymore. it's not what you know.... it's who you know. and with my felony my reputation is nothing but shit. my real worry is that this is one of the highest paying jobs in my area. $ 16 an hour plus almost unlimiteed overtime. for a felon even with a degree that's phenominal in florida.
america is just not fair.
i will try and talk to my manager, thanks for trying to help me out. have a nice dayl i doubt it. this country is about to fail.. i've already made plans to go to brazil. then paraguay.
my son has moved back from nyc and does not like my boyfriend.
hi. i am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from nyc.. my boyfriend and i have a home and my son does not like him.
he is going back to school and i am supporting him in that. the problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. he gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me.
he knows that i am torn. i am not going to put my son out of the house. i am also not one to get loud and angry. my son verbally is aggressive.
yes, and i have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. he cannot take his frustrustations out on us.
he came back last march for what we thought at the time would be a month or two.
he is difficult to get through to. he seems to have traded midwestern charm for nyc bullying.
i am not sure that he can afford that, but i have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. i want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy.
that may work with a therapist. i have tried to mediate and both were terribly bull headed and argumentative.
i am a quiet person and i want a happy household..
thank you. i want him to grow him quickly. he is 25 and is doing okay. no need to be angry.
thank you. have a good evening.
my girlfriend of 2 years left me for another person.
not doing well. i cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else.
we were together for 2 years. it was such a surprise when she sprung this on me.
i feel lost. i'm so used to her being around everyday. now i don't know what to do with myself without her.
not only that, but with covid going on i have noone i can see to talk about it.
yes, i do, but they are far away.
i do have friends, who are also friends with her. however they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. i don't have any true hobbies. i don't think they will fill the void anyways.
i do software development, but its a work at home situation. so i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy. all i do is think about why she would do that. i've had time to myself but its not getting any better.
what positive are there here?
it's ok. pays the bills. but my job is pretty independent. so i don't even get to meet new people. i am usually home, while she was always out of the house during the day.
what, you want to break stuff to relieve stress.
well, i'm going try going for a run right now. thanks for the suggestion. i'll see if that helps.
appreciate the talk, and suggestions. i'll give it a try. have a great night.
trying to find a job with good hours
i am having problems because i need money and the only jobs i can find are outside of the hours i need to work and i'm having anxiety.
yes, i called a staffing agency and they matched me with a job but i will still be coming home late. so i am trying to put in applications elsewhere as wlel. well *
i am walking.
yes, trying to find a ride but the bus also stops going. maybe i could call an uber home.
i think the stress outside of the job is also contributing.
like i am having relationship issues, in a long distance relationship and i jsut came home and have been missing him and i am torn between the two states. also just safety issues.
what do you do for safety?
two months but we've known each other way longer than that.
i think the uber is a good idea. i don't have many friends who would be up at midnight for the ride or be open to it.
oh it's okay my bad!
yes.
well mostly he'shaving problems affording rent too and i can't help him much and it sucks that i can't help him ata ll.
yes.
it makes me feel sad and lost. i'm afraid he's going to lose his apartment.
no it doesn't.
yes. i helped him financially a lot but i'm at my end too now.
yes.
no, not really i mean if i had more i would give him everything i could that wouldn't leave me financially behind.
no i wouldn't. i want it to help support me.
yeah, i just want to be able to have my own stuff again. i've been relying on doing surveys online.
yes.
also being far away from him sucks.
you are being very helpful by the way thank you. we aren't facetiming. i just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it..
just leaving him.
i think he would but he hasn't been feeling really good about his appearance lately. i asked and that's what he told me.
same.
that is very cute.
i don't know if he would be open to that but i could try. he isn't really the romantic type.
yes.
probably just being at home.
yeah probably. things are hard right now though.
the financial things make things emotionally hard. i am one of the only people he has in his corner right now.
yes sort of. he was let go cause of covid.
yes he's trying unemployment.
unemployment helps you find jobs and pays you while you do it here.
my friends won't hang out with me
hi, i feel really sad.
my friends won't hang out with me. i am alone all the time.
yes, but also just no one to hang out with. i am a loner.
no. i want to hang out with people.
i like to talk with them, listen to their stories, just hang out have a good time..
what do you do to feel better?
that all sounds great. i think i'll need to do more exercising. i do like reading so i'll do that too. thank you for the suggestions! i appreciate it.
all the best to you too! good bye.
the ongoing pandemic. my husband i like to travel and planned that for our retirement years. i feel we have lost a whole year already and only have taken one trip. we usually do 5-8 trips each year.
not too well. i have been depessed because of our state shut down and today an old friend from unior high school passed.
thank you. i know we are all in the same predicament.. i think things will improve, but not for a year or more..
a year is a long time when y. a year is a long time when you are 76 years old. i just want to enjoy the rest of our lives - my husband and me - and travel until we can't enjoy it any longer.
thank you so much for your support. it is tough and there is nothing to do.
yes, i do, but i can't talk to my son in florida because he lost his job and havng tough time. i don't feel like i should enjoy my life when he is suffering. we may need to help him financially. i use to volunteer at a nursing home, but i am afraid to now with the virus.
i am trying to do what i can for my son and also to help so i don't get too down and depressed.
thank you - that makes me feel some better. you are right and i learned more than ever that some things i con't control. yes, we are all struggling and trying to get this this pandemic. i am sorry that we are all going through this and pray it will get over soon.
yes, we will get through this - it helps so much to have others support. i do thank you very much for talking with me today. have a great day!
i am falling in love with a friend who doesn't return any feelings like this.
somewhat stressed but otherwise ok. how about you?
i'm developing romantic feelings for a friend but she doesn't share those feelings with me in return.
yes, i had received that advice from someone and tried it but it didn't help. we have been friends for a long time and i think it would be tough to smother these romantic feelings.
i have but i'm sure she wouldn't react very well and it could damage our relationship.. i'm also pretty sure she's already aware. she's pretty sharp.
that sounds like a good plan. i do like having things out in the open instead of holding them in. my other thought was to maybe try to seek out a romantic partner that isn't her so then maybe the feelings would go to another focus and it wouldn't damage our relatinship.
no, it has been difficult with the whole corona virus thing. i have taken a large income hit and also i'm having trouble finding someone who wants to actually go do something.
i think i'll give that a try. i could use a new hobby anyways.
i feel a lot better nwo that i have some options.
yes, thank you. and you also have a great day.
i don't seem to able to lose weight.
same old.. still trying to lose weight. already on day 20 for fasting. did not lose a single pound.
i tried keto diet for 6 months, didn't work. so now on fasting.
i also go to gym 2 times a week.
yea, very discouraged...
i am already lucky that i can sometime able to book swimming pool close by. i considered but they said i am not overweight.
the added weight is putting pressure on my hips and knees.. causing a lot of pain as well for my lower back.
no, i have to look after the kids..
i signed them up for swimming classes so they can exercise too. thanks for your suggestion though.
i can't join their classes. yes, i am doing that..
and even after exercise, i only eat 20 % of their portion and no junk food. nice speaking to you though, you have been very kind.
thanks for your encouragement!
girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me
yes i'm okay, i'm so sad. five years, i gave my heart to this girl.
yes she broke my heart last night, what did i do wrong?
but i gave her my all. i feel so betrayed. i'm feeling so sad i want to jump over a bridge.
you think it's my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart.
thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me?
well i don't know. why end so abruptly.
she just said it's over! over the damn phone.
not at all, so heart broken.
no, she won't pick up her phone.
my job contract is ending in another month but i was informed that i would be let go and the contract would not be renewed. i am very anxious
not good. i was told today that my contract is not being renewed once it ends this month. i am very anxious about finding another job during pandemic.
but i tried negotiating. they are down - sizing the entire sales department. what else can i do?
yes i am preparing my resume but job vacancies are few and far between. i am worried about my next job.
ok. do you have any ideas for sales positions?
i will. how can i get help from friends? only very few are in sales field.
i agree. i should never give up. but due to financial commitments, i am somewhat afraid of failing.
yes, so far life has been kind to me even if it surprised me at few places! i will try to make the most of the situation.. you are right! hard work will pay. i need to pull my socks up...
sure, after all i am known to be a fighter!.
yes i will. thanks a lot for the encouragement! i truly appreciate your motivational words.
i caught my boyfriend cheating with a friend
am fine. at least for now.
yeah... i have not been able to meet with my boyfriend physically due to the corona lockdown, and when i finally got to see him last month i discovered that he is cheating on me.
he has but it is not sounding convincing enough. i feel so hurt.
there is nobody i can talk to about this, i dont really have friends and my siblings are busy with their lives.
sure, thanks for this.
yoga sounds interesting but i will try starting it by weekend. some calming music will do at the moment. any suggestions for me?
thanks so much for this, i feel a weight lifted off my mind.
sure, you too.
worried about losing my job
anxious. i think my boss wants to fire me.
thank you. i think if i am late again, i will be let go.. i have a sick child and my boss does not understand. how can i explain that i may be late to the office, but that i am a valuable employee?
no. but that is a good idea.
it's a very competitive office and i don't want to look weak.
i do. i hope i can explain the situation clearly and offer to make up time by staying late.
i will reach out to hr.
thank you. you have been very helpful and uplifting.
my anxiety is disappearing with the suggestions you have offered.
i have only been here for 6 months. i think being new is contributing to the anxiety i am feeling.
thank you for your encouragement.
my ongoing depression is getting worse due to this pandemic.
not so good unfortunately.
due to this pandemic, i am fearful for my job security and future in general.
there is currently a lock down in my area. it seems like things are getting worse. my anxiety is high.
i doubt it will get better, but thanks for the positive vibes.
no, but i've been taking medication for my depression. any suggestion on activities to help me past time?
that is great to hear. i wish i had someone i can talk to. now i feel even more depressed.
what kind of book genres do you recommend?
oh, i will definitely check that one out. any suggestion on tv shows?
i've suffered from depression since i was a kid but since the pandemic started it's harder to find the motivation to go on, to go about my day, to get out of bed, etc.
i'm just feeling really down lately and would like to talk to someone who understands.
thank you. i think since the pandemic it's gotten worse. it's hard to find the " reason " to go about my day.
i graduated in the spring but haven't been able to find a job because of what's going on, so that's been tough. my wife works from home though. what about you?
very true! i try to keep a routine with exercise and cooking, things like that. going outside for walks...
oh that's great!
that's true. very good points. it's hard to find a purpose right now because i'm unable to find work. when i started going to school i certainly wasn't expecting any of this to be happening ( obviously ). i waited until my 30s to go to college so i feel angry that all of this is happening..
i lost my aun a couple weeks ago
yes, my aunt pass away a couple weeks ago. and since then im feeling really sad.
is there something i can do to feel better?
no, i live alone, my family lives in another state.
i feel like everybody is in their own bussines and have no time to hear my complains. i talk to my family, but the whole family is not doing really fine.
yes.
yes, i feel like noone wants to listen. i need to do something by mnyself. can you recommend someting for me to do to feel better?
well maybe it could works, to mantain distracted. thank you.
thnak you, i think it helps to have someone to chat. makes me feel better to chat a bit with you, helped me to relax.
i hink, im fine for now. i will try to keep myself focus on different things. and try to chat a bit more at leaat with my family.
i think he might want me back. he wants me to work with him on the board.
im good. how are you? just dealing with this guy.
yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me.
very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn't see me cuz he was busy. now he's asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me.
confused! i'll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn't like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them.
cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell.
yes but i'm afraid what i'll hear.
it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i'll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face.
possibly. i'd prob be better being away from the situation.
i think i would. i tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also.
it gives me an upper edge and more clout.
being on the board gives me perks.
yes and i think he is using me to a degree also.
yes.
it's a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power.. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me.
i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment.
if you were me you would forget about him and the board.
yes but it's less than before cuz of covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this - if that makes sense.
yes.
true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don't think it's a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too.
yes when it comes down to it. he suspected it happened. his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it.
now that im talking to him i do a little. it felt good at the time like i was getting back at him. you can tell this is a very twisted situation.
thank ya for listening. i think it'll clarify itself in time.
i am currently studying my masters and i am feeling intense pressure from it. it is online and each module is in such a short period of time that i am feeling out of my depth. i am also in a new job which is increasing my anxiety.
i am really struggling with my studies at the moment, i am so anxious that i keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time.
yes, i am a mature student and struggling with my course.
yes, the pandemic is making it worse. i am working as well so i am struggling juggling them all and running a house. i just don't know how to get back on track with my studying.
how would i go about that?
okay, i can see the sense in that. have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible? i do have a couple that i could contact, i've been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think i am being silly.
okay, one week doesn't seem too scary. i could colour coordinate it, i like things in colour.
ok, do you think i should reach out to my classmates, will they think i'm being silly, i really don't want to alienate them.
i don't think so, however, i might just start with the template and see if that helps first. i like the idea of breaking things into the chunks.
thank you, i feel a little better, maybe i just needed some control. yes, that's good, one thing at once.
thank you, you have been really helpful.
thank you..
me too. thanks.
my friends aunt is in the hospital with double pneumonia from covid.
hi.
oh no. i hope its not covid!. my friends aunt is in the hospital with double pneumonia from covid.
i hear ya. just bought some claritin this morning for allergies. i agree. at least she is responding to the treatments in the hospital.
i was happy to hear it too. i've been extra careful not to get it cuz of my parents.
i sure do. thing is people my age are getting very sick with it too. and some elderly are not. so i could be helping myself more than my dad.
yes absolutely. never know. its a weird virus. best to keep immune system high which i have been.
yes and started taking airborne for vitamin c.
me too. i feel like im living in a bubble lol.
i hear ya. we just have to hope for the best. i already made thanksgiving meal yesterday for my dad and dog. they both slept after eating turkey lol. yeah for real lol tons of bubbles in bubble wrap.
exactly. ive been shopping since covid. its very theraputic actually. cheaper than a shrink lol.
oh no lol i hear ya. lol shopping can be addictive.
like chocolate - which i have a stash of - woops lol.
lol.
nope im good. thanks for talking with me!
my boyfriend left me after i confronted him about cheating on me. he admitted to cheating and was happy i knew. then he told me he had been trying to figure out how to leave me and i now made it easy for him.
i have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. i have lost interest in everything i can barely make myself go to work.
i thought i was a good girlfriend, i was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. i must just be unlovable.
i trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. i thought we were so perfect together, i don't want him back i could never trust him again, i am not sure i could trust any guy right now, i am so hurt and confused. i don't ever want to feel like this again.
this was the first guy i ever lived with, i thought we would get married one day. how do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts.
i have a couple acquaintances at work but i wouldn't want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but i almost couldn't stop once i started. he was my best friend and who i talked to once we got together i didn't seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. that is why i am here for support.
have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? does the aching inside ever get better? how long will it take?
i am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. you have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. i do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. he said if i ever needed someone to talk to he was there. i thought he was just being nice. maybe i should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere.
thank you for checking on that for me, i hope it is quicker i would hate to feel this way that long. i think i will go see him he is home right now. you have made me feel hopeful and that there will be an end to these feelings and maybe things will go as well for me as they did you. thank you again.
i became jobless. my boss and i had a disagreement and she terminated me.
i am okay. a little anxious i am feeling helpless.
i am worried about upcoming bills. i lost my job.
about 2 weeks. christmas is right around the corner. i dont know how i am going to get the kids presents.
i don't have a lot if family.. i have my sister who lives far away.
yes, my kids are older, yes i am married and he is working. he isnt easy to talk to..
its off and on. some days are better than others.. i think its just the weather. its cold. gloomy that doesn't help either.
i am just ready for 2021. it has been a scary year all around. hmm, maybe i should try that..
vitamins cant hurt anyone. i just hope 2021 is better for everyone.
yes, it is more an independence thing. i hate having to rely on him. our relationship is not stable.
i do not know what kingsley, my very close friend will be thinking right now. he asked me 1000 dollars that he will pay back in a week time, although i have the money but i have planned to get my wife a car today.
hi. i am not sure i offended my close friend, i'm scared, he will see pictures of the car i bought for my wife today on my status. actually, i have initial plan to get the a as a birthday gift for my wife before he came to ask for the money.
i don't know how to explain the matter, why i can't borrow him the money.
yes, you are on l ine with me. yes.
no, he saw the post of the car on my status, but he did'nt say anything.
yes, naturally he will congratulate me as he viewed the pictures.
ok. can i face him, to ask such question.
may be i should tell one of our friends that i think he is mad at me.
so, we can both settle the matter, i did not have enough money to borrow him at that time because of my initial plan for my wife. ok. thanks for your time.
yes.
okay.
yes, by god's grace, i trust holy spirit he will help me, bye.
bye.
conflict with parents
well they won't allow me to date this girl i met online.. they told she's bad news.
yes, i tried but it won't get through their head. there are so old school. they want me to date someone close to my age. is 15 year difference too big of a gap?
they told me she's gold digger. yes i come from money but hey this girl is the one..
nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill..
ok, i will talk to them this weekend. what's better on the phone or in person?
hate talking to my parents face to face, all they do is yell and i get frustrated.
that's a great idiea. i will bring my g. f or is that a bad idea?.
gotcha. i will bring my good friend. i'm sure he can help me out. great advice by the way. i'm so mad though why my parents care who i date. man i'm old enough. let me make my choices.
thank you it will. will talk to them this weeked with a friend present. wish me luck : )
i have a final exam coming up and i am really worried about how i will perform.
how are you going to help me study? i am not sure if you are familiar with my course material...
my exam is about contract law. i have the whole night, but i have studied all day and am exhausted.
wow, that's actually a really good idea. i have a friend who took the course last year but i am worried that if i ask her for help she will think poorly of me.
that is true. i will reach out to her now.
i still have some self - doubt given that i have failed an exam in the past...
i really appreciate this advice. i am feeling better about the exam and feel like i should envision myself passing and doing well.
i will give it a try!
you too! wait! i have another concern.
do you have any tips for staying cool under pressure while i am taking my exam?
that is great advice. i will certainly try and get a good night of rest.
nope : )
daily, normal activites of life are hard for me to be motivated to do or to complete them at all due to my depression. i feel ashamed that i am not like other people who can complete things like hygiene care without a struggle.
i feel upset with myself over my situation. did you read it?
i feel ashamed of my depression symptoms. i feel other people are ashamed of me.
i just can't live reguarly life like " healthy " people do and they notice my symptoms. they don't understand how your mind can be your enemy.
like i have no interest or motivation to do anything some days. hard to even take care of my hygiene. my mind doesn't care to do it even when it's embarrasing for people to notice.
stay away from mean people, stop tryiig to explain my symptoms to others who won't get it.
i go to all my therapy appoints and try to participate. thanks for your help. have a good day.
i have to go now. bye.
thanks.
about 3 broken hours a night.
yes, i know all the rules. my mind just wont rest.
yes, it will take weeks and the holidays are just around the corner.
i know, with all the other crap going on now everyone else has their own problems they don't want to hear mine.
they're busy with other people's problems. i'll deal with it.
i wanted to travel but that's not a good idea right now.
i live in a small town and were are suppose to self quarantine unless we have to leave the house for work or go to the store.
i did, everything is gone now..
i do like to cook. i'll probable do more of that now.
that is a good idea but nobody is suppose to go to other peoples houses.
thanks for the help have a good evening.
i did not study and did poorly on a test.
hi there. can you help me?
i did not study for a test and i very poorly. i feel ashamed!
exactly. i did not try!
i just don't feel motivated to study.
ok i will do that. thank you.
ok i will try. i think the problem is not trying for sure.
great advice. thank you!
i think that's all. i feel better now. i'll try more.
i think i've drifted apart from a friend i've known since college because of the pandemic. we rarely communicate and the last time we did she tells me about the things she has been doing with her new friends.
i think a friend i've known for 30 years since college has drifted away from me. even during the pandemic she has made new friends.
she has cut our conversations short by saying she is tried. she will return text but i feel like i am always initiating. she likes watching tv show and told me with her new friend they facetime and watch tv together. i really hate watching tv so don't want to offer to participate.
i am jealous that she is more successful in making new friends. i have not made a new friend in over 10 years.
i don't have many other friends and they are out of state. the one we are talking about lived an hour away but we would see each other 4 to 6 times a year,
hurt, mad, jealous. i have trouble getting out enough to make friends - even if there wasn't a pandemic. i work a lot.
good to know i'm not alone.
work place is very small and i'm not in the clique there. vaccine will be available to my age group soon and the weather is getting warmer. so there is that to look forward too.
good idea. i really hope being able to take walks will help me clear my thoughts.
i may join the book club when the library reopens.
i had a stable job that the income can support my living and my family's living until pandemic hit. the company starts to lay off people including me. i had no other experience and it was difficult to find the job outside as the restriction and shut down effect the ability to go outside.
what should i do.
i try to find a job but there is not many.
about 6 months.
yes.
i will seek for another jobs if possible but i can work on manufacturer company too.
if i can work remotely i will do it.
the job market is very competitive. i tried but there are no responds after my interview.
do they charge you when you get a job?
thank you, there are no many availability of what i can do and it is just out of control from nowhere.
thank you for your kindness.
this time is too hard for me fine a jobs which require me to search and get pay for unemployment.
no.
i don't have resume.
i will need somebody type one for me.
thanks so much.
yes, i did,
yes, but i have something to do at home.
i have to take care my grandson.
no, i have to stay with him, he can not go to school.
no, not this time until school open.
i am severely stressed about my college course and my grades during the pandemic.
i have a college course in the evening, but i cannot concentrate while distance learning. i am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along.
it is stressful. i am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because i must switch back and forth. i have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. my colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly.
i don't have a second screen, but i do have a large tv. i may be able to hook it up via hdmi.
sometimes i get really anxious. my ears will be pounding and i feel like i can't hear anything. it is worse when using in ears, because it's like all i can hear is my heartbeat.
that sounds like a great idea. have you had any weird technological solutions to help you through distance learning?
i have considered making impulse buys to help with some things. do you know about portable second monitor screens for laptops? it seems almost like a thin tablet that you plug in to your laptop. i like the idea.
i enjoy portability and minimalism to a fault sometimes. i enjoy being able to work from anywhere. do you live in an apartment or home?
my friend is a good friend of mine but he is not a suitor as in i would not want to marry or date him but my fiance still gets bothered by me talking to him. i don't talk to him anymore but can't see why he still considers it microcheating even if i don't talk about our relationship.
okay how are you?
just pondering microcheating and wondering why someone who i do not like that way would be considered microcheating.
it is a new thing like having a man you like that you check up on on social media even though you are in a relationship, or eating lunch with the same woman or man that you like but you don't act on because you are married.
yes i see that. no nothing else going on just thinking that the definition maybe shouldn't be as exact for the type of person that i do not talk to because of his reservations about it.
that is what i feel. i am not talking to him. i had to the other day to get in contact with someone ( medical emergency ) but do not call just to chat and catch up. i even unfriended him. i just want to comfort him over it but i think it is best just to never speak of him again. comfort my fiance.
no i am ending my friendship with him. that is what is best.
yes very.
yes, i think that would be best. i thank you for your time.
it is okay see talking about this is actually microcheating. so now i am worried about that.
yes that is true. my fiance is over seas for work for the next 13 mos so i am here in the states alone. we get to talk but he isnt here with me so having no one to talk to is lonely. that is why i brought it up.
yes i don't have any friend that arent men so i think therapy is going to help. i don't talk to anyone anymore. but i thank you for your time. i just wanted to clarify why i brought it up. i hope you have a good day.
i am having worries about an old test i failed in university. it didn't affect my academic future and i passed the class with an a, but it still haunts me.
things are ok i am just having issues with the problem above.
yes, so i have always done very well in school and university. i have always had a's or high b's. last semester in university, i failed one of my exams. i still passed the class with an a, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams. i don't know why it happens and it worries me.
maybe, i got a 46 % on the exam ( so an f ) but i did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an a overall. i never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud. i come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m, e. me *
yes you are correct.
i have not, actually. i don't think my family can afford a therapist, especially with the pandemic raging right now. where do you recommend going?
i have never heard of such people, i am interested.
i think you're right, but i don't know, i'm still scared about having the bad dreams. i often wake up 2 - 3 times at night because of them.
thank you, i'll try to do just that. merry christmas to you.
i have a friend that completely screwed me out of money on a business venture.
i could be better. how about u?
a friend screwed me out of money and a business venture. i am no longer friends with her. we were really close before this..
it does. i've known her for 14 years and we dated. i invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. she took the money and ran.
what do you suggest?
no. other than the money i transferred to her. hello?
a cat cafe. where you can hang out and work or drink with adoptable cats from the local shelter..
i gave her 80k. no messages. it was all done in person. do you think i should get a lawyer and call the cops?
it is. i don't want to go to the police. i think they are all corrupt and raciest.
that's great advice. i will do that. i have a mutual friend that is a lawyer.
pandemic and family stress
trying to stay positive but keep having too many thoughts at once : (
its so stupid. i keep worrying about worrying or having something bad happen. the thoughts just come so fast.
tried that. its become more of a chronic thing, like sometimes i cant controll the thoughts or like i dont know how to relax. like a chemical thing.
i have one and it helps sometimes. i try to meditate.
i pretty much have to do it constantly.
yeah maybe its as simple as that. i know im the problem cause its very obvious that im the on ein control of the thoughts for the most part.
right. i will try and start that more today and commit to it.
yes i agree. when i consistently use meditation and positive attitude, any bad things are defintely minimized.
yes. do you meditate? '
my friend borrowed money from me and she did not return it in the time that we agreed.
yes, i am very dissapointed because i trusted her completely.
what did you do to come out of the tricky situation? yes, it was for me, a total of $ 10000.
yes, i am very very upset. what would you do in my position? yes, she just sounded non - comittal, saying that she will return it when she can.
yes, i asked her how we could restructure the payment in her favor because i understand how difficult it is for everyone right now but she did not answer.
we were speaking on phone because i wanted to set up a physical meeting where we could discuss the logistics. yes, it is a financial burden because this is money i was saving for a venture.
yes, this is a really close friend from way back and i would be devastated to lose the friendship. it is difficult to judge on the phone yes, which is why i wanted a physical meeting but she snapped at me and said that she will just pay me when she can.
yes, very difficult.
how do you suggest i shoulp proceed?
and you chose what?
thank you very much for the advice.
not being able to find a job after graduating from university
kinda sad today. wanted to ask for some mental support.
not being able to find a job after graduation.
okay.
yes i did, and quite a lot but i think because of the pandemic they are not hiring that much.
yes.
i've tried linkedin they have many companies hiring. maybe my cv is just bad.
i think i could improve it.
i've asked some friends, i think a friend will help me out when he's not busy.
yes i know.
it's hard with this virus to go anywhere pretty much.
worst time to graduate. haven't even got the graduation ceremony lol.
yes at least i graduated. haha. thank you.
have a great evening and thanks for suggestions : )
i am frustrated, as i am looking for a job and despite sending in multiple applications and reference letters, employers have not even acknowledged receipt of the materials submitted, much less expressed anything suggesting that i am under consideration for the position.
it's been tough. i've been looking for a job for months, but feel like i'm getting nowhere.
well, i am fortunate to have a job, but i am seeking a different job because the one i have does not pay what my skills are worth. it barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills.
i have, but there are few decent jobs out there. most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk.
last week, i submitted an application package for my dream job. i have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing ( which i have seen before, and it is quite nice ). i have heard nothing at all. i would have to relocate 4 hours away, but i would do it in a heartbeat for this job.
what makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job : it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. i have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. working there would be ministry, not typical work. and because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships.
thank you. i believe there are three things in my favor : i know the job well, as i became friends with the person i would be replacing, my pastor wrote a glowing reference, and i was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current ( related ) job fifteen years ago.
we worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer / work partner? i know a few of the higher ups from the area churches, and a handful of families. i know half the core staff i would be working with daily and think of them as extended family..
the benefits are nice, also, such as staff are provided meals prepared by the banquet chef and his team when at work. and though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team.
at the risk of preaching religion, i believe god may be calling me to serve there..
when off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests. there is an olympic sized pool, field games, a gymnasium, an exercise room, and if off duty, one can attend most any of the events on the campus, unless designated as a private event.
because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that i get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes. it would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along.
the music events year round are outstanding. they have many well known names in christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing. to be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless.
as i said to my pastor, just to work somewhere where people say thank you and ask how you are doing rather than criticize every move would be such a blessing. and since i work nights already, i am more than happy to cover the office overnight to attend to guests who have locked themselves out, or have other concerns. i used to live on site at the motel where i work now, and on my days off, all i did was make keys and walk the grounds to ensure safety. at this facility, there are beautiful benches to sit and watch the moon and stars and enjoy the sunrise or just take a moment. there are covered gazebos and a couple buildings have deep covered porches for days when it's a bit rainy or the sun is strong. and we're across the street from mountains and a river. the campus is simply beautiful.
i pray you are right. i feel as though i have been running on a hamster wheel, but it has brought me to this. fifteen years of directly related experience, with about another 15 to 20 years of customer service, call center, and customer facing work.
thank you. i don't mind the work, but it would be nice to also have appreciation, that is what makes the current job difficult is that i feel taken for granted.. thank you.
.last christmas i bought the condo of my dreams. this april i lost my job due to covid 19. i have used up my saving and my unemployement has run out. i have received an eviction notice. i don't know what to do. help!
here! last christmas i bought the condo of my dreams. this april 2020 i lost my job due covid 19. my unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted. i've recived an eviction notice and don't know what to do. help! have you ever been evicted?
i'm still in my condo but i no longer have a job, umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone.
when you say work out a plan what do you mean? i have no job. i have been applying for jobs but i haven't received a callback or an offer of employment. have you ever been in this situation? also, i'm calling a helpline so pride is not my issue.
it's kind of hard to work out a plan when you don't know where your next meal is coming from don't you think? do you know anything about the eviction process and where do people go once they have been evicted. who is this they that your speaking about? i don't mean to be crass either but i have never been jobless or homeless either. so i'm desperate here and don't know what to do?
how did you eat and where did you sleep when you were homeless? how long did it take to end your situation? if you were homeless what did you say to your landlord that they still put you out? where did you wash up or brush your teeth?
i rather not say. but thank you for you for sharing and i hope you and your family have a good thanksgiving.
what should i do about my break up?
it happened yesterday. she broke up with me.
i will try but i don't think she will want to listen. i do not think she likes me anymore.
i think i will call her later, i will try to follow your advice. what should i do to help my bad emotions?
i feel bad about the whole covid thing. i think there is a lot of stress about it with my ex girlfriend so she feels stressed about that.
i feel really down and upset lately, more than ever, during this pandemic.
doing alright, thanks. yourself?
good to hear.
i've been feeling very down lately.
sure. i feel depressed about the state of the us and of the rest of the world. it's very overwhelming..
yes and a lot of uncetainty.
it's good to know others feel the way i do. i've been trying to keep busy and not watch the news too much.
yes with lots of conflicting information.
work, read, exercise. i've been going to the gym more.
thank you. i'm trying. i really don't want to be on medication.
i am trying. i don't want to fall deep down an emotional black hole.
yes, my husband is very supportive but i don't want to upset him too much so i don't fully open up.
i will look into the telehealth. thank you for that recommendation.
i will give that a try. thank you again.
nothing i do pleases my boss
hey! an doing better but things at work place gets me real down.
i think boss hate me.
nothing i do pleases the man. all he does is complain.
i think its directed to me.
if am asked to complete a task, i do complete them and make sure no mistake was made, if he will evaluate the task he always sees fault in what i do.
he never give time to listen. i think i'll quit the job.
i never tried talking to his secretary. i think that's a good idea.
i try doing just that, i hope it works.
thanks so much.
my friends are not taking the current pandemic seriously and often have get togethers.
yes, they aren't taking covid seriously.
yes but they get angry with me. i don't know how to get through to them,
i really don't know i just haven't been seeing them at all but i see through social media that they have large parties but i do feel left out. it's a weird dynamic.
that's exactly right.
i'd like to think so but i wish they would too. it's hard to know what is right.
yes, but they'll have their bbqs and parties anyway. they are having a group thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. my husband and i feel bad that we aren't going, but we also know it isn't smart.
we feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time. and i agree. the longer we put it off and don't take it seriously, the longer it will last.
yes that's totally accurate. yes they are. they are good people. they just think living for the moment is the bigger picture.
i think they do. they just think that this is a hoax.
that's scary. yeah i don't think they get it.
thank you. i hope it gets better. but anyway thank you for giving me the chance to open up.
getting new year present for my parent
going smooth, i need to get a nice and a surprise able present for my parent, and at the same time i need to pay my house bills. my father understands the situation that my earning is not that much, but my mum will fuck complain that i am taking care of my wife but not her.
yes, your are right, i cannot stay in house without paying bills. yes, i am working but the income is not that much.
that is the major concern, the gift is once in a year and now all my bills are needed to be paid at least before end of the week.
may be i should use credit card to get her new year present and use my salary to pay the bills and rent. my presence is much important likewise. i will need to be happy and get rid of this fucking depression, i can't kill my fucking self.
not being able to do my daily routine is really getting to me. it's hard to get up every morning.
i'm doing okay..
i'm having problems with getting up everyday and doing my daily routine. i feel bad because these are things that other people do normally.
exactly. jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed.
yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. i've been doing mturk here and there. i plan on doing it more. it helps me stay productive.
okay, i hear you. thanks. yeah, i guess i have to really force myself.
okay okay. cool. that's a helpful concept. i'm going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. yes, that's true. i hate ending the day knowing i've bummed it out.
yes, i agree. i used to go to at least one concert every year. now that's out of the question. it gets boring and a little depressing. hopefully 2021 will be better.
i will definitely. i just got to get up and get with it. i'm really in need of some exercise so i'll do that too. i used to paint and draw but i kind of fell off and stopped doing it. i'll get back into that too.
i agree fully and i'm happy for you. i think i've been in some sort of depression for some time now. i stopped doing everything i loved. i used to love jogging but i stopped doing that too. i ended up gaining a lot of weight and now i don't like going anywhere or being seen at all. i'm usually 130 and i've shot up to 200. so i think if i can just get my routine down and exercise, i'll be alright.
my industry has been shut down since march due to covid-19 and i've been struggling to find work that is safe for me to do (i have asthma and a blood disorder that compromises my immune system), haven't had any success with unemployment and really just very stressed about money.
i'm surviving. today is better than yesterday was.
i've been out of work since covid closed down the live event industry in march. the unemployment system still hasn't processed any of my claims, and i have been surviving off of what i can make driving for doordash, which hasn't been a lot.
ugh, yeah... i drive a really old beat up car though, so i can't really go out after dark, and i'm worried i'm driving it too much and it's going to break down. i wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs i've applied for would hire me to do something form home.
no, i live with housemates but they all don't drive.
im sorry im late. i am still applying, but only for what i can do from home, and i worry i am underqualified. are you still there?
okay, well thanks for chatting with me and helping me earn the bonus for this task!
i was going to marry my girlfriend but she broke up with me a prior to proposing for an unknown reason.
hello, how are you doing today?
i am glad you are doing well, i have been struggling lately as my girlfriend that i was going to propose to broke up with me. she told me that my career path was different then hers and she just did not see it working out.
she had a desire to do marine biology and i wanted to pursue law enforcement as a police officer, however due to my back injury that fell through recently. she would spend most of her time doing field work, which would require her to spend time out at sea. she was working in a nursing home at the time and was not a marine biologist..
i am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship. she now has a boyfriend which she started date about 2 months she broke up with me. i found out that he works with her at the nursing home. i am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn't see how our career paths would work out and that was that..
i have had some friends echo that. i agree, it definitely felt like i was giving a lot through the time we dated. i have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her i think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. the new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that i think has caused me to question her parting words.
i appreciate your feedback on this, ( this event for context occurred about a year ago and i have moved on from it ) my support system has said the same thing. i think the difficult part is just overcoming that mental / emotional hurdle of having the desire to marry her, which failed since it was an expectation of what was to come. i appreciate your suggestions. i think being the best " me " will help equip me for my future spouse! : ).
what did you do to help overcome the depression you faced or the grief of what was?.
that is a valid point, i appreciate your help with this situation and listening to what i experienced..
have a wonder christmas, maybe we will chat again on this forum! happy turking : )
my husband abandoned me and my kids
hey.
okay i guess. north carolina.
what about you?
watching tom and jerry with my kids.
what you doing?
im 28. a mother of two who just moved after my marriage fell apart. i enjoy cartoons, reading, gaming, and listening to music and audiobooks.
lol.
hmm i hate dating again. my kids are both specieal needs. i live with my mama and grandpa.
i guess. i love my family. im glad to get more time with my grandpa who is 73 years old. mama has always been my rock and is a great suppirt with the kids. soits not so bad. thats my goal.
i guess im really mad that i invested 10 years into a cowardly man.
i worried if i will be able to complete my degree.
hello, how are you?
i am doing good. can i talk to you about something?
i am worried that i won't be able to complete my degree.
i can't get motivated, it doesn't seem worth it.
what do you meditate about?
i feel like i would sit there and worry about things i have not done yet.
maybe it will calm me down. does it make it easier to concentrate?.
that sounds amazing, i should give it a try : )
i just lost my job and am worried about paying the bills.
there is just too much pressure, but i have to succeed.
i am trying. i've started looking online for new positions but it is a process.
i just still am continually nervous and having a hard time coping.
i haven't but maybe that will help me stay calmer.
that makes sense.
i haven't but that may be helpful as well.
that might help me to take the stress off myself and get someone to help in the search.
yes, i'm starting to feel some of the pressure taken off me.
i feel a lot better. thanks for your support.
a person i was dating broke up with me in a terrible manner.
i'm very upset. he yelled and yelled at me.
yes, after seeing him act this way i agree. he said i was worthless.
i know. i do deserve better. but i was with him a very long time.
more than a year, but i've known him since childhood. that's what makes me so mad!
how did you get through it?
not one!
he's a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him.
yes, he did.
i'm just so angry that i could break something. and maybe i will do that!
but what if it doesn't pass? and i cannot afford therapy.
i don't know if i could do that. i don't like talking about my problems with strangers.
that's what i am afraid of. being judged by people.
maybe i will do that. horses are so cool.
i sure am. thanks for your help.
the covid-19 pandemic has caused me to be depressed. i am sad because there is nowhere we can go. we have to stay home and that is getting depressing. my husband and i want to travel but we can't. we are retired and feel as though our lives are being destroyed.
hello. i need some help. i have been depressed.
i am not doing very well. very depressed with having to stay home because of the covid - 19 / i will appreciate anything you can do to help me.
yes, it sure is. i feel so alone. i feel it will help to talk to an outsider.
sometimes it helps to a stranger - most of my friends feel as i do. i am sure you are right - i thank you for your support..
no, we haven't talked about that, but that is a great idea. i will talk to them to see how they feel about doing this. thank you.
i feel somewhat better just thin. i feel a little better now. i look forward to talking with my friends about doing zoom.
thank you. my husband and i are going to go for a ride later. that will help.
thanks. i am looking forward to gettng out for a while.
i am losing my job in january. i am very worried about looking for work right now
not so great - found out i'm losing my job in january.
yes i'm not even sure what steps to take right now.
not yet, i'm not even sure where to begin. i have not looked for a job in 20 years.
i've tried calling the unemployment office to get some ideas but they do not answer their phones.
yeah, i'm kinda old for that - lol!!! my back would not hold up to that - and my salary wouldn't be comparable.
well i hear that their offices are closed and you have to do everything online - so not sure if they can even help me.
i think i might be able to call my friend, but she's in another state.
that would not be enough money. i would not be able to pay my bills.
that's true but i don't want to lose my house either.
she may be able to help - she could at least send me in the right direction of where to look and maybe how to freshen up my resume.
that is true - i just hate to bother her, she's got so much on her plate already.
my school was closed without warning because of the pandemic.
i am so frustrated.
yes, my school was closed without warning because of covid.
yes i don't even know what is going to happen with finals now.
i hope so. but i feel like this could have been handled better. not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor.
thanks. i feel like my head is going to explode though. the remainder of the semester is going to be online.
yes, i talked with my friend about it and she said don't worry. but i can't help it.
i was doing so well in my classes too. very close to graduating.
yes, i don't do well with online learning.
i hope so too.
thank you and thanks for letting me confide in you. it's a weird and sad time these days.
thank you so much. and i hope all is well by you too.
my school is extremely rigorous and i'm experiencing difficulty with anxiety
it's just a huge amount of work that i'm struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety.
do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though?
yes it's all virtual though.
that is a good idea. do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things?
i see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college?
okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down?
okay but is it normal to be upset?
okay that makes me feel better.
that's it! thank you for your help.
catching up with academic deadlines
hello, i am fine at the moment, but i just have a general sense of nervousness as i am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines.. and i have a few assignments and two exams coming up ( all to be done at the end of this and the next month )
right, plus i am nervous because i am scared that i won't do as well as i would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. just that fear as impending deadlines come up.. so i guess i need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well..
i see. i am kind of doing that but i do get sidetracked from time to time. i get distracted by my computer and the tv, etc. it's on and off like that. i agree with you that i find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me..
and plus i find that when i drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, i become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that's one method i have used.. thank you for your trust in me..
i guess also on top of the fear, i also feel a sense of disappointment because i am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible. true, very true.. like what also helps you? and can you elaborate on your strict regimen?
thanks for sympathizing and understanding..
ok. that's true and i have to do more of that. phone is also a big distraction for me. i heard that it's best to get it out of one's reach for best results.. timer, great idea..
i think that's pretty good advice. i know which room i can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading. ok, i will employ these methods more.. thank you for sharing these.
then hopefully after these two courses are done, i can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results.. not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious..
yes i hope so, because when i was younger, i used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books. and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, i am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation..
yes it has on us all. i guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down.. so yes, the second wave is here it seems ( belatedly ), but hopefully it doesn't get worse, because i have seen worse in other places right now.
so i suppose just trying to cope with that also because i get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and i also have to write my exam outside of my home.. ok. i could look into that. i work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year..
yes and i have been and will continue to do that..
but aside from these stressors, i think i have a better idea now on how i should proceed, starting today.
not that i haven't, but just with more renewed faith and having fresh priorities in my head.. yes thank you very much for listening and understanding with my issues..
alright then. i will continue my day from here then. thanks again, and good luck with your endeavours!.
i am dealing with a covid-19 quarantining situation. can't interact with family and friends. wife is super paranoid about the virus.
i am dealing with pandemic depression. we are completely isolated. can't see friends, family, hug grandkids...
it's been going on for months with no end in sight.
how do you deal with it? yes, some video chats, but not the same.
then there is my wife. she is very paranoid about the virus. she sanitizes the house even though no one comes in it. bitches at me.
i appreciate your concern. it helps to have someone to vent to. is this going to end soon???
that sounds really good. i do value her, just not the paranoia.
i failed an exam last semester and have to stay in school for another year.
i have been better. i had a rough semester in school..
it was alright at first but i failed a final that was worth 50 % of my grade.
yes, i already tried to appeal my grade.
sadly, no. i think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me.
it was a core class and i needed it to graduate.
that does sound like a good idea. i am just so disappointed i'm not sure if it is worth it.
i think you're right. the class is tough and i know i can do it if i put my mind to it.
it is very intimidating but again i agree with you. thanks for your input.
true! i can definitely use the time off before i go back to clear my mind.
i was talking with another my partner have seen that incident
i feel depresed.
3years of time we have been in love.
but i love my partner so much that i couldnt forget her right now.
yeah we went for trip we had a god relationship.
we had enjoyment and romance.
none i love her so much so i have not done anything without her.
i was doing good.
sighting girls.
yes. after having a chat with you i feel some goodness in me.
thank you so much.
fine love you.
thank you.
my son had heart surgery this year and is in the midst of being diagnosed with cp. i work with a lot of people and am terrified i could catch covid and it will kill him.
doing great. how about yourself?
so, the issue i'm having is work - related. my son had heart surgery a few months ago. he now has a pacemaker. he's also in the middle of testing for cp. my job requires that i be around a lot of people. i always wear a mask... but sometimes the people i am with do not. nor do they respect the 6 - foot boundary. a simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. im scared that if i continue to work, im putting him in danger. but if i stop, i can no longer afford bills. my son just turned 2.
i have. a few people respected my wishes. but one in particular stands out. a gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. he got angry at my request. in my shoes, what would you do? because i feel like im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol.
it makes me feel trapped. frustrated. i would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and i feel like i don t. * don't get the same courtesy. i feel frustrated because i'm required to deal with people. i work in construction. i feel trapped because, what are my options? continue to work..... my son gets sick and dies. his pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. and if i quit? no money? i have a 5 year old i have to take care of too..
i've spoken to my boss. he was sympathetic about it all.... at this point i'm not sure what to do.
those are fairly decent ideas. the struggle for money would still be an issue if i worked part - time. and i doubt i could find a better job at this particular time. with that being said, i didn't think to see if the boss would let me work in the office for a bit. i know my fellow employees would respect my wishes. any other suggestions?
that sounds like a reasonable thing to do. i do get paid vacation.
the pandemic has placed me in a financial crisis and it has negatively impacted my academic standing.
hello i am in need of assistance.
hello tom, this is dillon.. i haven't been doing well in my academics.
in college. i started off really well until the pandemic hit. now my family is struggling financially and it has greatly affected my academics.
what kind of jobs did you take?
i'm trying to find a steady job. jobs that can help support both my family and my tuition.
oh okay that's interesting. there's a part time job at a local library should i take it?
thank you for that.
the library is within the campus.
you did? how was the experience?
but overall was your experience working in the library pleasant?
wow! that is quite the experience tom. i might just take the job then since it went well for you. anything to help support my family and my academics during these trying times.
haha i'll maybe focus on the job at hand first tom.
that's good advice. thank you for listening to my situation and giving me advice tom.
i just broke up with my boyfriend. i am really depressed and lonely now.
i am feeling really sad and lonely right now. my boyfriend and i broke up and it was me who wanted it but now i regret breaking up and he doesn't want me back.
that is exactly it. i broke up with him because i liked another person but then quickly realized that i made a mistake and it's too late. i want him back should i start calling and going to his house to beg?
i haven't really thought of that yet. he has a pretty short temper actually. i know he is really mad at me so i think he might want to yell at me and get his anger out before he could start being nice to me again.
yeah, that's true. i have been secretly watching his social media and he has girls asking him out and i don't want to let them get to him before i can get him back. i want to make it up to him somehow and do whatever he wants to get back together.
i can try that, i think he might be responsive at first if i dont set him off. all of his friends hate me so i have nobody on my side right now. should i try to get his friends to like me again? is that an way i could use to get him to want me again?
i can understand what you mean. i need to think this through.
well, we are in a small town and he was popular and the cutest guy in our town. i liked being with someone so popular. he wasn't always nice to me and is why i wanted to be with someone else for a short time. he used to leave me at parties and go off with his friends sometimes.
my friends always said that i could do better and that he didn't deserve me. he gave me statis in our town and everyone wanted to be his girlfriend so i think i liked the attention, yes.
i really liked being with the popular guy who everyone looked up to. my parents don't like him at all and have wanted us to break up the whole time we were together.
i have never thought of it this way. you are making a lot of good points that i never thought of before. when i think about him i miss the way i felt in terms of being popular. i don't really miss him as a person.
my friend has a new friend
its so annoying and hurtful.
i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful.
i could try to focus on myself.
i agree, i need to focus more on myself.
its hard to but i know that its time to focus on me more.
focus on me, doing things by myself instead of with my friend. going to eat, spa time, me time, only with me. then allow myself to make new friends. do you have any suggestions that i can focus on.
reset of our minds, interesting. i will try hiking for sure. thanks for your input.
studying for finals can be very stressful, especially when the exam is cumulative of the year's content. its super pressuring when you grade can teeter on the border of as, bs, or cs since the exam is so heavily weighted on the final exam. its depressing that you can do well in all other aspects of the class yet do poorly on the exam and have all that effort be for nothing.
hello.
i need ways alleviate stress while studying.
yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you're in a dead end situation.
how did you push past that job?
are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career?
is there any advice for getting out of my situation? aside from luck that is.
i just find the work mundane and way too remedial.
did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job?
what types of skill can i gain online?
so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that i can complete?
i have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there?
and have you showcased your skills using linkedin before? i have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background.
do you have any examples of online skills you completed?
if i was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations?
yes but i may change my mind.
yes i have been networking as i go.
yeah i mean the topic was about final exam stress but we got on a tangent.
15 minutes.
yes i probably should, thank you for your insight!
yeah no use in cramming for more info when i could just chill out.
my boyfriend left me out of the blue. he is not responding anything clearly. he is avoiding me now.
yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then?
i can understand all of this. may be i need some time.
hoping the same. want to be the happy person like i was before.
i think i should divert my concentration on something else.
it really hurts when the person means you the most becomes unavailable out of the blue without stating any reason. nothing. thanks for your support anyways. i am glad talking to you.
none. how are you coping up with the current situation?
why can't to cook in your home? is there anyone to help you?
i am sad all the time, and i always have been sad.
feeling depressed as usual.
everything. life. it's awful. how many years do you really need to stop enjoying this place. ya know what i mean.
i would say that is fairly accurate. often times, i wish an asteroid would come down and begin the apocolypse.. something to break up the routine. don't you find life utterly boring and repetitive?.
sorry to hear that. anxiety and depression are dual bladed sword of badness. really bad mixture. i never struggled too much with anxiety..
no! i would never do that. i'm already on anti depressants. that didn't help at all.. i just don't understand why people like life enough to make more people! it is madness!
well, i'm glad it helped you. i'm not just saying that. being depressed is awful.. what did it do for you? how so?
i understand. well, i appreciate your time and advice. i just don't feel like you and i are understanding each other very well, though. anyway, you made your bonus. i appreciate you trying to help me, though. we got to talk for another 4 minutes though.
i used to have more hobbies. now, i'm not so motivated to do much of anything anymore. i used to play instruments. i like hiking a little, but it is winter now. so... i can't even do that. plus... i have to travel really far to do that because there is nothing to hike that is very close.
i am not performing as well as i would like to in school. it is causing me stress just to keep up
tired. and u?
just trying to finish this semester.
mainly hip hop and r & b but i dabble in some alternative, hyperpop, and edm.
yea. have u done any of the virtual concerts?
whos some of your favorite artists?
i love those guys too. need to listen to more of their discographys though. my favorites are kendrick lamar and kanye west. 15 mins past. i guess we're done.
yea i dont agree with some of kanye's ideology but hes still extremely talented. you too.
my friend played a stupid prank that revealed my secret that i told him in private
hi. i am really angry.
really angry at my friend.
i told him a secret about my self in private and he played a stupid pranks that reveals it to other people i don't like.
he said he was drunk.
ok. and i already keep my distance from him.
yes i won't. funny thing is he didn't remember what he did that night.
absolutely.
i am definitely sharing my secret anyone ever again.
i hope so.
i will sleep soon. it's nice getting the feeling out.
thanks for the chat.

please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now.
yeah i like to play football.
yeah sure.
now im feeling well because of you.
thanks my friend.
thake care bye my friend.
i had been dating my college boyfriend for almost a year and we had begun to fight increasingly over the last few months. he ended up breaking up with me on our anniversary.
not too well. i am feeling pretty down right now.
today was my one - year anniversary with my boyfriend. he broke up with me today. we were at school ( our college campus ), and we had a huge fight.
maybe i can think that way in time, but right now i don't know what to do with myself.
i probably should have seen it coming, we have been fighting a lot lately. that's true, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it right now.
yes, everything can feel worse this time of year because of the stress of the holidays.
i have actually read about that, but i have a hard time focusing when i meditate. i suppose i just need to practice more.
like the calm app?
i like incense, but it makes my allergies act up unfortunately. what else can i do besides meditation?
most types of incense are too strongly scented and make me sneeze or feel sick. candles are much better for me.
i haven't heard of that website before. i'll have to check it out.
well, i haven't been in a long - term relationship like this before.. my past relationships were all in high school, and they only lasted a few weeks or months at a time. i really cared for this one, and we were together for so long.
you had a fight with your partner? i'm sorry, it's the worst when people fight over what's supposed to be something nice.
i forget what started it, it was something stupid. he didn't like the way i said something and it kind of blew up from there. we were fighting over the smallest things these last few months. it just kind of built up to the point where he said he couldn't take fighting with me anymore and just wanted to end it.
end the relationship, i mean. you think maybe if we just take some time apart, he might want to talk about it?
he does get upset very easily.
i do think it is important to take some time and breathe.
yes, for most of our time together it was wonderful. he made me laugh very easily. that's part of why i'm so sad that he ended the relationship.
two or three, yes. and we would fight over the smallest things, it was really stupid.
yes, and it was our one year anniversary. we were supposed to order takeout and watch a movie and exchange presents. instead we fought and broke up.
i think you are right. unless we went to some sort of counseling. but it probably is for the best.
anxiety about losing my job
i am not good at all.
this pandemic is causing too much of trouble for me. firstly pay cut and now about to layoff.
my company don't want to consider any body at all.
and i don't know what to do.
i don't even know what they will decide.
this is not affecting only one person it is affecting every body in the company. nobody know who is next.
the jobs are not there any more. many people are affecting because of pandemic.
business? without capital now, it can't work.
i'm scared that my best friend and my boyfriend are doing something behind my back.
yeah that's true.
so i live with my boyfriend and my bestfriend. and i am afraid they are doing skethy stuff behind my back. it sounds crazy, and i don't have any proof but i have this feeling. the way they talk around each other makes me nervous.
i'm scared when it is just the two of them here at home. and they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in.
not really specifics. it's more of a just in general sort of thing. i know them both really really well, so i am just picking up on tiny little details.
i have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it's crazy i would think something like that. idk... i don't want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it's really nothing. i don't know if there is actually something i should be worried about, or if i am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons.
i don't know who that is.
does she do live talks or videos? or is she more in online writing.
oh that's cool! i will have to check that out. so you think maybe i am feeling this way is because i have shame or vulnerability in the relationship?
yeah.. that's true. i think it's a good idea to learn more about how i'm feeling before i make any rash decisions.
ohhh wait i think i have seen that one haha. it was shown in my class in like 9th grade.
yeah you are right. i think i am just overthinking a lot. i will look into that ted talk. thank you so much for the advice! i appreciate the conversation.
i want to change my situation and improve but i am so depressed i don't have the energy to look for a job much less perform them adequately. on top of that my town has almost no jobs (2 thousand people in central kansas)
i lost my job due to covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move... but then job closed.
i hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic.
i did not make enough to get unemployment they said. i have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is i am in a very small town. like we dont wal marts or mcdonalds or anything like that. whole town closes at 9. the closest actual city is 45 miles away.
i will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month, we shop for the month and i stay with my siter.
well i have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as i am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing.
and appreciate that especially during the current situation.
you as well.
i have been sad for a while now but lately due to not being able to find a job, i am feeling very low
i am not feeling too great.
i am not able to find a job for over 5 years.
i am on social assiatnce but its not enough and i feel so worthless.
but i have been tryin for so long, i dont know what ti do.
yes i did do a lot of interveiws but no one hired me.
i feel that i am not worthy and that no one thinks i am capable.
how can i do this.
i get depressed when i am rejected every time.
do you have any tools that can help manage my depression.
how many times should i do this.
okay i will try this and see if this works. shall i also try walking or exercsing.
i broke up with my girlfriend yesterday. i had been with her for years and now living life without her feels heart breaking.
i am really depressed because of my recent break up.
yeah.
i was with her for more then 2 years and without her everthing seems incomplete.
what should i do now?
that is very true. what i need right now is to distract my mind and think about something else.
i mostly play soccer.
i have my best friend and he is also helping me recover but my main issue is inner will power.
my mind is just not accepting the change.
it was one sided and that is why it's so problematic. anyways.
yeah. i'll try my best to do what i can.
currently i live with my sibling because i couldn't afford rent, so it is saddening to me. i don't have my own time for day to day activities with my kids.
hi like i said a bit down.
ohh thank you for the offer. proscanation is my thing i guess, and this days i am paying for it.
yes it affects everything.
i didn't meet deadline a year back, and lost my job. now i couldn't even pay rents. living with a sibling.
probably.
thank you.
no no no... me the super optimist.
will achieve my goals with proscanation or not.
i have pills of written works, short stories, poetry novels and a few paintings, but not published yet. i might do that.
there is always " next year " so i am waiting for it...
thanks for talking to me, very supportive.
yeah. nice talking to you. will leave you now.
my business is suffering because of the pandemic. i'm very worried i won't be able to pay my bills soon.
i am so stressed out because my business has suffered this year. i am very worried i may have to close and i won't be able to pay my bills.
i sell cosmetics. i think a lot of people don't have money to buy non essential items right now.
that might be true. i just don't know that business will ever recover.
mostly online.
yeah we don't have to shut down. but with so many people struggling to make ends meet, there just doesn't seem to be enough left over to buy extra things. and that's true. there are people on zooms that want to wear makeup.
yeah that's true too.
