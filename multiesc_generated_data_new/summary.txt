<s> good support chain, for sure.	it is making me have flashbacks of other traumatic situations, i think i need to find a good support chain, for sure. what say u? you take alooonnng time to respond.	 @[Providing-Suggestions-or-Information] 	there are many counselors who specialize in this field of job security and especially during this pandemic and the falling economy, they are great support systems.	Many Americans are hurting.	i am having a hard time.... ok, i will look some of them online. i need some financial planners to help as well. many americans are hurting.	 @[Providing-Suggestions-or-Information] 	if you want other suggestions, meditation is something that is extremely overlooked and will help you before you even take the big leap to get support from a counselor or relative. just taking deep breaths in a quiet area is a great way to clear your head and keep optimistic.	Should I look elsewhere for jobs?	any other advices? what else can you advise me on? should i look elsewhere for jobs? i will have to try that. maybe it can help me ease my mind.	 @[Providing-Suggestions-or-Information] 	since a lot of this stress is being caused by your childhood trauma, it seems like there is something that connects that job to your trauma and if it cant be disconnected, it seems like you should find another job. and i understand that is not the easiest in these times but i believe you can do it!
