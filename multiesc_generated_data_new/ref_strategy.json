reasonable amount of alcohol ?", "i have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when i was younger and i found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types . have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking ? .", "certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks . sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep ... the amount you drink . do your friends

looked for new jobs mostly . i was on unemployment insurance for about a month before i found a new job . have you made any plans yet about how to move forward ? i can offer some suggestions if you would like . i know about a lot of resources .", "well , falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while . if you have any food insecurity as a result , there are often local food banks . it 's really not something to be embarrased about , so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own . you could", "well , if it 's possible , i would talk to a doctor . if you 're looking for over - the - counter sleep medication , melatonin has helped me in the past .", "it defiitely helps me fall asleep . it 's a natural sleep aid . if something like that does n't work , i would talk to a doctor . i know money will be tight though . are there any free clinics near you ? .", "thank you . i hope you 're feeling a bit better . is there anything else you want to talk about ?", "alright , well i hope you have a good night . good luck , you 've got this !", "bye !", "hi there . yes , what is making you sad ?", "i understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities .", "have you talked with your friends on how you feel ? when was the last time you all connected ?", "i understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you , especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee . i 'm sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club .", "from what i have experienced personally , i am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends . after turning them down a few times , they stopped inviting as well . i think they thought that was not my thing .", "i feel how this is hurting you . the best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities . let them know you are still free and really want to spend some time together . do you think you can open up to them on whats bothering you ?", "it sounds like this situation is really bothering you . its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated . the bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation . if they do n't know what is bothering you , it will be harder to mend the relationship .", "you are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth . find common ground , an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you .", "we all have busy hectic lives at time . true friends make time to be with one another . this world is full of beautiful people to bond with . keeping a closed circle of friends is a blessing .", "i hear how this is making you sad not feeling supported in the way that you need to be . know that you are worthy and will find a way to connect with them . i hope this has helped .", "good afternoon . how may i assist you ?", "what is unit ? are talking school .", "what age are you ?", "i understand your dilemma . i am in my 60s and desiring my degree as well .", "the covid has put a lot of students is a bind .", "have you ever heard the phrase you are never to old to learn ?", "yes he truly stands by you .", "i started going to college in 94 and still going .", "he will see you through just keep a positive attitude . what is your field of study ?", "i know what i am after , just have to be persistent . that is a good choice of study .", "are you full time .", "what about online classes that enable you to study and work also .", "there are classes you can take that can fit your schedule .", "but do n't give up what you started . take classes now . see what you need and take the classes that will enable you to keep gpoing .", "just never give up . two years will go by quickly if you keep attending . look for grants that will assist you .", "so keep applying yourself and reach for your goals . have a good day .", "hello , what seems to be on your mind ? .", "i see . how long have your two friends been arguing ?", "it sounds like tempers are all running pretty hot for everyone right now , is that correct ?", "well , it sounds like you are in a tough spot since both your friends are so mad at each other .. why do you think your one friends shared a secret they were supposed to keep ?", "i think i understand . sometimes we accidentally hurt the people we love when we are trying to help .", "i think it is great that you want to actively help , it says a lot about you .", "sometimes the best way to help someone understand is to give them a little time and space . trying to force someone to understand does n't always work .", "you could also try talking to your hurt friend like this and ask her if she thinks the other friend truly meant to hurt her . i bet she knows that was n't the case . i bet you guys will all be friends again in no time .", "hello .", "i am good , how are you ?", "i 'm sorry , what type of problems are you having ?", "so just to make sure i understand , you are having issues with your friends not being there for you emotionally and you are worried about them taking advantage of you when you go out ..", "i completely understand what you are feeling . have you tried to talk to your friends about your concerns ? it helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective .", "i have had the same problems in the past with some friends not being there for me when i need it , so i completely understand where you 're coming from ..", "do you have anyone else to talk to about what you 're going through ? it also helps a lot of the time to talk to an objective 3rd part to help give you some advice on what they think you should do ..", "another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies , i often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me .", "i enjoy building model cars in my free time , it really does a good job of keeping me occupied . i also find that reading helps a lot too !", "not a problem ! i am glad i was able to talk to you tonight !", "hello , how can i help you today ?", "oh no ... i am sorry to hear that . it must be devastating . was it an accident , illness or natural old age ?", "that is rough , both for you and him . i know it 's meaningless to tell you not to be sad , however , you can think that he 's not in a better place .", "oh sorry , yyeah i mean now . life is ... fleeting is n't it ? i sometimes think it 's meaningless too .", "i feel you , coping with losing your loved ones is never easy . in fact , it 's confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on .", "i do n't think people can completely get over that , you just get used to the pain of not having them around .", "i just need you to know that whatever your feeling is , it 's completely normal and you should n't feel guilty for having it .", "your dad would n't want to see you grieving everyday either . you should live the way you know he 'd love to see . i believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued .", "that 's sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time .", "have you considered seeking therapist ? we almost never think of that service , but in a lot of case , people actually need help from professionals when grieving .", "i 'm glad i could be some help for you .", "hi , how are you doing ?", "not bad , it 's a peaceful night . anything in particular you 'd like to talk about ?", "i imagine that 's very overwhelming and stressful to think about . are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being ?", "i 'm sorry that you 're having to deal with such stressful circumstances . you can only control what you can control . have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions ? i get it though . it 's scary for everyone at this point .", "it seems to me that they should take that information into consideration .", "is there someone else you could go to about this ? besides whoever you 've already attempted to discuss it with ? yeah you 're right . covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could 've never prepared for .", "thank you for talking with me too ! i hope it has helped some . at least you know you 're not alone ...", "you 're welcome . i wish you the best and many blessings .", "hello there , how are you doing today ?", "well that is good . are you trying to come off it completely ?", "well , do you worry about your consumption ? if you do n't i do n't see it as a problem : )", "ah yes , it is not cheap . i am not sure how much to suggest as it 's not legal in my country : )", "i am in the uk . it 's sort of a grey area ... police wo n't really do anything but you ca n't buy it over the counter .", "yes i would be too . even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot . the us seems to be really strict on it tho .", "they were but i did n't pay much attention : ) i vote in the generals and the locals but that 's all .", "i like khan : )", "i like him too lol .", "but i do n't get to vote for london mayor . only if i were a london resident or nearby would i ( sorry for tortured syntax )", "haha i do n't indulge these days , except for once in a blue moon : p .", "not where i am : ( all we have here is sheep and cows .", "north west but close : )", "i do n't think derry people would like being referred to as part of the uk ; )", "yeah ... heh i do n't go there , being half english and half irish : ) . but yeah that was so my era ..", "anyway nice to meet you and all that but i think we have sort of fulfilled the criteria : d .", "you too ! can you press quit first cos i ca n't from this end for some reason : )", "hello , what is on your mind today .", "i have big shoulders ! whats on your mind ?", "i think a lot of people are feeling that way these past few months . do you think it is covid related ? not sickness , more depression .", "its becoming a new normal lol .", "a few months ago i was feeling the same way . i dont have health insurance but googled and found some online docturs . i got to see a doc and get on antidepressants for less than a hundred . covid plays a factor in everything ugh .", "all online ! : ) meds shipped to my door . i love it !", "can you make a new one ?", "they are doing so much things now , you just got ta get on google and see whats out there ! i think you are going to be okay , there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need . that is great .", "i agree , just with all the covid crap i know it can be hard to get a face to face ! : )", "its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps . is there anytihng else you want to talk about ?", "hang in there !", "nice talking to you !", "im sorrty im here .", "why do you think you are going to lose your job .", "that 's not a good spot to be in , i completely understand .", "that is horrible . do you mind if i ask why ?", "how long have you been working there ?", "i understand , i have been in a similar situation recently . covid - 19 really has got us all down .", "i agree , this country has got some issues but we can get through them . uh , oh , how do you think she will react ?", "the good news is that we are on an incline for unemployment so there are a lot of opportunities out there .", "you could maybe tell her at the very end of this year so you can start fresh for the new year . do you have a resume ?", "sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things ... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath .", "i hear ya , i feel like that quite a bit . like if is n't one thing it 's another . i 'm sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it is n't your fault .", "sometimes it 's hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times , but remember all the good times you have had . those would not be good times if it were'nt for tough times .", "well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery , maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times . do you have any hobbies ?", "exercise also releases endorphins that can make you feel happy .", "i like to hear that , i am a proud american myself .", "it does wear off , but if you get into a routine of doing it , it will help to alleviate some of that sadness . ok thank you i hope things get going in the right direction for you . merry christmas !", "hello ! what is on your mind today ? oh really ? why is that ?", "being mad that your boyfriend cheated is normal . being mad when dumped is normal . do n't you think you deserve better than he was treating you ?", "i 've been there too . expecially with covid , it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new . if you really love someone , shouldnt they love you back ? did his actions show love ?", "if you did get back together and get married , how do you know he wouldnt cheat again ? what if you had kids ? they would have to see you go through heartbreak . i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart .", "i married mine . 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter . trust me , its not worth it in the long run . maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you !", "i think a lot of couples are feeling stuck with covid . once things open up and everyone is vaccinated and get togethers happen again , i bet there will be a lot more breakups and a lot more options out there ! all we can do is learn from our mistakes and not let the past repeat itself .", "with your newly aquired free time , you can focus on you ! start a new hobby , dye your hair , do something you always wanted to do !", "know what the best part is ?", "get yourself fixed up and cute , and find a hot new guy . your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy . its quite theraputic : d", "exactly ! you deserve so much better ! make yourself feel like it and everyone see it ! : d : d .", "what happened ?", "how are you feeling lately ?", "it 's okay . we should learn from things like this .", "do n't think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most .", "can you tell me how are you before this incident ?", "can you share me some happy memories which made you smile .", "it 's okay . i can understand . yeah me too . i love movies and traveling .", "well , just think of some happy memories and try to spend time with people who value you the most .", "oh , thats nice of you . thank you .", "you too !", "hi . how can i help you .", "oh , thats bad . when you lost your job ?", "in which field you are looking for ?", "you can try as a school driver . as school now opened you will get it .", "try uber and that is good choice as you are not doing anything .", "oh ok take deep breath and just keep applying . i am sure you will get something good . believe in god !", "that 's really good . keep trying your best . apply everyday for job . you can start with grocery stores . i am assuring you that good time will come soon .", "that is nice to hear from you . i thinks you are happy now .", "hi ! hope you are doing well . how can i help you today ?", "it seems you are having hard time to fall asleep . hope i get it right ?", "is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long ?", "it must be a tough time for you and is a enough reason to not getting good sleep . despite of it you should need a complete rest .", "i feels like you are having less energy and feel tired due to lack of sleep . try to follow a particular schedule and u can put soothing music before bed . it might calm you down and make you sleep .", "when i have sleeping problem , i take warm shower . it help me a lot .", "as far as i know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually we start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it .", "i can understand how hard it is for you . but nothing stays same . i wish your daughter will come out of it soon and wishing her success . meditation can help you too . before sleeping you can concentrate on your breath .", "yes , i am a parent with 2 kids and can understand your situation very well .", "how are you doing today ?", "it is a stressful time , why are you feeling stressed ?", "i can understand .", "i have 2 kids , how many kids do you have ? i have a bachelor degree .", "managing things all become stressful , but im sure you are really good at what you are doing !", "thats are not true , you have beautiful kids , work and pursuing master 's . you are a great achiever .", "deep breaths and practicing mindfulness will help you relieve some stress .", "i sometimes do meditation or go for a 10 mins walk .", "good afternoon how may i help you today ?", "i 'm sorry to hear that . is there any change in your routine as of lately ?", "these past few months has been extremely difficult . in the past , what did you do for your depression ?", "talking to a professional is always ideal . is there a way to see that psychiatrist again ?", "it would n't hurt to try and reach out . if she is n't available , there are other services .", "not necessarily support groups , but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat , or video and its specifically through the app .", "there a lot more since covid began in march , so it 's worth as a backup plan if your doctor is n't available . sometimes its good to have options .", "after my son was born i developed post partem depression and anxiety . it was n't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it .", "it was . luckily i had my doctor to help me . family members meant well but chalked it up to `` that 's what its like to be a mom `` but it is more than that .", "i agree . there is a lot of well meaning advice out there , but its best to see a professional to really help you .", "i 'm glad i could help . i hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist , or at least find a good one through an app .", "hello , how can i help you today ?", "ah that sounds tough , why exactly are you stressed ?", "okay , i understand , i see how that can also make your anxiety worse . currently , on a scale of 1 - 10 how well are you understanding your course material ?", "that 's completely normal you have n't made any progress . that would make things so hard and i applaud you for coming so far with that going on !", "would you say your problems start with your roommates ?", "i completely understand , the same goes for me . it can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line .", "yes , and i completely get it ! its so hard to self - manage without the right resources .", "ah and then they started rolling in , correct ?", "me too , unfortunately for us , universities do n't seem t have the same sentiments . for starters , i think it would benefit you to eliminate the more closer problems : your roommates . have you tried talking to them ?", "makes sense , isolation makes it hard to form that connection . i can see your dilemma . are you currently working ?", "can you tell me more about the fight ?", "breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple . is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else ?", "breakups are hard , but it sounds like she was violent .", "have you talked since then ?", "if safety is an issue , then i think that maybe moving on is a good decision .", "i suggest that you do things that will help you get over her. , like going out with friends or a new hobby . do n't be in a hurry to get into a new relationship , but if one happens that would be great too . is this your first breakup ?", "breakups are not always the end , but they usually happen for a reason , and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on .", "i suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities .", "the sadness will eventually pass and i am sure there is someone out there that will be a good match for you .", "i wish you the very best .", "good afternoon .", "can i ask for a reason why .", "what is causing you to be sad .", "so this is a close friend .", "that could cause a sadness .", "could it be for a reason you are unaware of .", "maybe she is busy and the timing is off . does your friend work .", "may not be a fight but she is busy settling in . does she live with her family .", "how long has it been since she moved in .", "have you thought about a housewarming gift .", "so just a week and she is settling in .", "friendship is important maybe she needs to hear from you .", "could she she is arranging the house to fit her style .", "have you tried to visit her and see if you can help .", "sometimes people get overwhelmed and need a friend to be there .", "that would be a great idea , especially with the holidays .", "yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people .", "why not text her 1st to break the ice . but maybe she is feeling like she is alone also .", "the virus is stopping people but we can find away . does she have other family .", "the card could be a nice gift .", "text and ask about her son .", "surprise her with the card 1st . then follow up with a phone call .", "hi there , how are you feeling ?", "it 's a really hard time to be finding new work is n't it ? are you getting unemployment or anything ?", "wow that 's a lot of kids . do you know that there are foodbanks out there which might be able to help you ?", "are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to ?", "do you have friends who could help you , even with child care ?", "i can imagine that that must have been traumatic . you will make new friends though .", "i am a poor person too and i 'd be happy to be your friend . we have to stick together !", "no need to return anything but friendship . thanks for talking !", "no problem at all ... i 've been there : ( ( genuinely , not just for the hit )", "best wishes : ) you need to press quit from your end though cos i ca n't do it from my end : )", "hello .", "how are you tonight ? .", "how can i help you ?", "so from what i understand , you caught your significant other texting someone else ..", "what types of things was she texting him about ?", "just from the few messages we have sent , i can tell you are very anxious and upset about this situation ..", "i completely understand this as i had issues with my ex fianc\u00e9 texting other guys and cheating on me ..", "i know how hard a situation like this is , but i know you can get through it !", "have you tried to have a conversation with her about it ?", "what if she does n't know you caught her ?", "i think it would definitely help to talk to her about it , it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about ..", "i can definitely understand the awkwardness of the conversation , it was tough for me to have that conversation as well ..", "they are very tough . did you need anything else from me tonight ? .", "you are very welcome !", "hello , how are you today ?", "what happened ?", "why did he break up with you ?", "i think you should try finding a psychologist to help your jealous .", "apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions .", "it 's good for you to do that . you 'll feel better with time .", "i feel the same way . when it had happened with me . however , i talked it with my friends and family and made me feel much better .", "you should spend time for yourself now . take care of yourself .", "i know that in the beginning it 's so difficult to do anything , you just want to sleep and do nothing , but with time you 'll feel much better and try start over .", "yes . you should do that . it 's not good to hold crying . you should just do what you want to do now .", "bye .", "hello , how are you doing today ?", "that 's terrible , i 'm sorry to hear that . you 're life is n't done , it 's just a new start . it 's scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband .", "then you 've definitely got a lot going for you if you 're 90 !", "why did he leave you ?", "it sounds like that is more of his problem then . you deserve someone that 's better than leaving someone because of their age .", "personally , if that 's how he felt , then you 're better off . i know that does n't stop the hurt you 're feeling , but you are worth more than that .", "being single does not mean you 're completely alone . there are a lot of resources to talk to someone and make friends .", "could you try something like facebook or instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances ?", "social networks online , you can connect with family or old coworkers . and post pictures and see what other people are doing with their lives .", "so you 're looking for a strictly romantic relationship ?", "can you go to the park ? maybe visit there to meet new people ?", "hello . how are you ?", "what 's on your mind ?", "i 'm really sorry to hear that . when did this happen ?", "there 's nothing that can prepare you for unexpected tragedies like this . we just have to deal with them as they come .", "it sounds like you 're sticking close to your friend , although it does n't feel like its helping . it 's my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that , making someone feel better , at least right away , is n't always an option . the most important thing you can do for", "of course . these things are tough to face on your own , so you did the right thing by reaching out . i know you want to be there for your friend as much as possible , and i think that will help you to move through grief at the same time , but just be mindful to not overextend", "you too , and best wishes .", "hello . i 'm here to listen .", "these days all of us have this situation . i can assure you that your family can understand it . how about an online job ?", "i also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus . i feel sad too . but we should go on .", "this sounds good .", "i wish this virus ends soon . but believe me everyone have similar situation these days . did they try any online job ?", "this sounds good . wish to learn soon . i am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the covid . you should be happy that you have them .", "of course but having them by your side is a gift . your welcome . i wish i could help a little .", "you too .", "hello . how are you feeling today ?", "it sounds like there maybe something you need to get off of your chest .", "what happened that made you guys break up ?", "i have also had this situation happen to me . maybe it just was n't the right timing or she had other interests .", "the first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself . if you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy , who knows , you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine . take it from me , i 've had this happen . sitting around sulking about it is only going", "what is your age ?", "you still have your whole life ahead of you . some people do n't find a partner until their 40 's or even 50 's . when i left my ex i found this guy that i truly fell in love with . he is still sulking in his living room . i told him that if he didn", "did she give you any reasons to why she was n't in love anymore ?", "did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating ?", "im sorry that this stressful for you . in my past , i have had exes do that to me . most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives .", "i would definitely confront her about it . i would n't get angry or fight about it . maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already . that is a really good indicator .", "i would calmly ask her . she will most likely deny it . but , some ofher friends may already know about this . if she says she did , ask her if there was something you did wrongthat made her do it . sometimes its not even the cheatee . sometimes they just do it for no good", "i 'm doing fine , how are you ?", "thats good what do you have planned for the holidays ?", "i completely understand that i feel that pain as well . are you there ?", "it 's ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time .", "exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year ?", "yes it 's the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones .", "i myself is going to enjoy good food and enjoy hopefully some decent winter weather . your welcome .", "no snow here the weather was really nice today high of 60 degrees . what about where you are at ?", "nice .", "yes in the us , thanksgiving was just with close family members .", "hi there , how are you doing today ?", "i understand that , it is hard to find a job . i got terminated during the beginning of covid .", "i actually took a job at walmart just to make ends meet . not the best situation but hey , my family can eat .", "yea , would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in ? or do you still collect unemployment at least ?", "thats good at least . well , its great you are being proactive about it ! i hate saying this but , just hang in there and keep moving on .", "yea i feel so bad for her . thing is so presents arent everythign . since you got little ones might be time for some new traditions . make some `` igloo `` forts and have an indoor snowball fight with balled of socks or something like that .", "thanks for sharing !", "hmm lets see , more a fun thing to do then advice , my daughter saw some xmas dessert she wants to make . its pretty simple . get some candy canes and poke em into marshmellows . melt some chocolate and dip the marshmellows into them . cover with sprinkles and let", "yea , i hope things work out for you !", "hi there . how are you today ?", "i 'm doing good today . what brings you on here ?", "ugh . there 's nothing worse than that . have you confronted the ex friend ?", "oh wow . that 's not much of a friendship ! so have you attempted at all to discuss it ? what does the other friend think about it ?", "that 's an option but i hope it does n't go that far again . have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend ?", "i can understand that . you do n't want two people disrespecting you ..", "i hear that ! what happened in court when you went ? if you do n't mind me asking .", "sounds like maybe you should pursue it again if you can . has she been in contact with you ?", "seems like a good idea . steer clear of her and do n't associate with her ! sounds like you 're doing the right thing . keep your side of the street clean .", "i would if i were in your shoes . you do n't need two of the same person . know what i mean ?", "lol if only everyone had that thought process . some people do n't get it !", "definitely sounds like you have the right tools and mindset to do the right thing ! i know about the alone thing especially in these times .", "take those tools you have , steer clear of her and do your own thing !", "take care !", "what 's wrong ?", "i understand . i , too , am struggling with covid - 19. it 's going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays . we 'll get through this , though , do n't you think . have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone ?", "is there any way you could talk to your supervisor about achieving a better work life balance ?", "it sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you . you just need a better work / life balance to straighten things out . i had a similar experience in the past , and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me .", "with covid - 19 , it may limit your options , but you could decide which activities you would collectively enjoy the most , and try to do them as often as possible together .", "yes , giving them a helping hand , getting things done together , could greatly improve your home life . are you feeling any better since we started chatting ?", "anytime ! it was nice meeting you . bye - now .", "hi , what brings you to seek support , today ?", "i 'm

feelings for someone who does not feel the same way . i have been there myself .. have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend ?", "have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings ?", "well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere . just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many

needs . and it seems like you are doing a great job exercising at the pool and employing other methods to lose weight . what is your primary motivation behind your weight loss goal ?", "that 's no good . i 'll bet that is difficult to deal with . have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks ?", "well , you could also take the kids on a walk every day . that would be a healthy activity to enjoy together , and it should help burn some of their energy too .", "that 's great ! now you can all go swimming together . maybe that can be an activity that you all do

share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through . would you e open to hear them out ?", "mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight . do you think that , you can try something like this ?", "i am so proud of you for giving this a try . i would like to suggest ocb relaxing music , which will help you relax .", "i am so glad that you are feeling better . just rest assured that i will be

tough time explaining it to my boss . have you offered to stay later to make up the work ?", "maybe your boss can compromise with you . it 's worth a shot !", "you sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee .", "i understand . is there a coworker or mentor that maybe you can talk to ?", "that 's a great idea !", "also review your employee handbook and see if there are things you can do to negotiate with hr or your boss in regards to your hours . always best to come prepared : )", "that 's great ! i am happy i could help you during such a difficult time .

situation . but you have to keep calm . you have to look things at this way , maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home . i believe god put us in this situation to appreciate", "have you ever try to talk to your love one at home ? or maybe take time to communicate more with your friends ?", "well i dont know when this is going to end but if we let this isolation win the we are going to get worse . so i would recommend to share time with your love one and clear your mind and take out all the negative things away . right now im talking a lot with my brother and me and him never", "another thing i can recomend is try to read some books . that will help . i dont like reading but im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place .", "well , i love fictions and mystery . right now i just finished `` the davinci code `` .", "i dont want to sound like a christian fanatic or something like that but the bible helps too . ever since this pandemic started i started read it and it helped me a lot .", "hello there ! how can i help you this afternoon ? .", "feeling consistently sad is a tough place to be . i 'm sorry to hear you 're going through that ..", "i can certainly understand that . are you working or attending classes from home ? .", "it 's very hard to maintain a sense of consistency when we have few boundaries on our time , or a daily routine ..", "i have been attending school online , and i occasionally make deliveries for my husband and i 's small business ..", "yes , a daily routine is good for normalizing change . it 's also good for structuring in time to relax and recharge , which you still need even if you are n't currently employed . times are still very stressful and uncertain , and that takes an emotional toll no matter who you are ..", "i understand being angry about that . going to school supposedly is / was a way to take control of one 's life , it 's no longer the guarantee is once was .. i sometimes feel a similar way about my own classes . i am also in my thirties .. but i personally enjoy learning", "can you identify why you feel sad ?", "it is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies .", "are you with family ? sometimes it helps to be with others who are grieving ?", "being by yourself is rough after a death . can you talk with your family by phone ? do you have a friend who has gone through a similar loss ?", "it sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your aunt 's death making you sad . is that correct ?", "do you feel you are complaining ?", "my own experiences with family deaths is they are sad . i just wanted to `` feel better `` . my experience was it did not help to complain about `` being sad `` but it did help to talk about why i missed my family member . if no one was available , sometimes i would journal . do you think that", "you are welcome . i am sorry about your aunt .", "that is why i am here . is there anything else you would like to chat about ?", "good bye ?", "hello there , how are you feeling ? .", "so , you are having trouble dealing with someone ? .", "if he says he trusts you i am sure that he does . he would not have asked you to work with him if he did not .", "that must be incredibly confusing for you . how does this make you feel overall ? .", "how does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him ?", "it is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this . have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are ?", "i realise that this must be difficult but is n't it best to get things out into the open ?", "i think it might be best for you to make a clean break . it sounds like you are being manipulated .", "certainly you would be . i know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run .", "you need to be aware that that can and will happen . ignore it . what sort of benefits do you feel that there are ? .", "in what way does it do that ?", "do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit ?", "let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there 's an element of mutual manipulation .", "you are definitely not the only person to feel this way !", "i feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board .", "but that is rather manipulative of you .", "yes i definitely would do that .", "ah i hear you . you feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown ?", "that is something i believe that most of us are feeling right now so i sympathise .", "i can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be . is he aware that this happened ?", "do you feel guilty about this ?", "do you feel that you want to get revenge on him ?", "i hope so and i really do hope for the best for you . these are difficult times for all of us !", "hello . i hope so . what kind of problem are you having ?", "it sounds like you are a student who is having trouble . is that correct ?", "i can understand how you feel . i was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school . it is very understandable that you are feeling stressed , especially with the pandemic and other issues happening .", "have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time ?", "if you go online , there are different templates for students . one would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day . also , do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support ?", "to start , fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do . set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork . try and stick with the schedule .", ". i would try it .", "maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous . break your writing down in small chunks . just brainstorm one day , for example .", "try one thing at a time so you are not overwhelmed .", "i agree . you are not alone .", "hang in there

but my recycling pile has gottene out of hand with amazon boxes . oops lol .", "a lot of things can be addictive !", "haha .", "anything else you want to talk about ?", "have a good day !", "i am sorry to hear that . reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self - esteem is that true ?", "do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better ?", "have you tried getting back out there and dating again ? just because he did n't want to have an honest relationship with you , does n't mean that nobody else does . also in my message above i have made a couple of autocorrect errors , apologies for that .", "relationship issues , especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life . you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves .", "do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you ? .", "ok i understand . it is normal to be upset in a situation like this . when i ask if there is someone to talk to , i meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup . there are also support groups out there that can really help . getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with", "when i was younger , my girlfriend cheated on me . we were together for 4 years . for me , it turned to anger not sadness , i was so angry that she did that to me . i realised that if she was capable of doing this , it 's better that i found out now , rather than when", "i think that that would be a good idea ! for info , in terms of how long it takes to get over it . i have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it . personally i think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup", "you are very welcome !", "hello . : ) how are you ?", "i am sorry to hear that . what are you feeling helpless about ?", "i see . i would be worried about that as well . how long have you been out of work ?", "is there anyone you are able to ask for support right now , like your parents ? i am sure they would understand , since so many people have been losing jobs lately .", "i see . and your kids are depending on you to be able to take care of them . i am so sorry ; i know that must be extremely stressful . are you married right now ? if so , does your spouse have a job ?", "i see . do you mean that you are not on good terms with him ?", "yes , i can understand that . it 's been cold and gloomy over here and my whole family has been in a bad mood . it seems like a little thing , but i find that taking vitamin d supplements when the weather is bad helps me not to get depressed .", "yep . me too . i 'm ready for all of this mess to be over .", "how important is it for you to be able to work right now ? does your husband make enough money to pay the bills and make sure you have somewhere to stay ?", "i can understand that . i am sorry . was it different when your children were younger ? what has changed ?", "hello , how may i help you today ?", "so you are scared your friend will get mad at you for buying your wife a car after he came asking for money from you ? is that correct ?", "have you talked to him recently ?", "has he said anything about the car ?", "do you think he is mad at you ?", "i know this can be a tough situation but i believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to . do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok. i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about", "if you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him . just do not force yourself if you are not comfortable doing that .", "if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know .", "i know how you are feeling about that .", "just try one of my suggestions and see what the result will be . i am really sure the situation will be solved .", "i hope i helped you today .", "yes he will .", "bye .", "what kind of issues do you think you are having ?", "i understand it can be very difficult at times with parents . especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today . have you tried talking to you parents about why she is `` bad news `` ?", "the basic problem is that your parents believe that 15 years is too large of an age gap between you guys . is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her ?", "you believe that the girl is not a gold digger , but instead you guys like each other for who you are . money is not an issue for you guys ?", "perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact . for example , if money is the problem for your parents , you can set some rules . like you can set an allowance for how much money you can use each week .", "if you want a better communication , i believe in person will be best .", "i apologize and i do agree it is sometimes difficult . perhaps it will be better to talk to them with another person present .", "if another person is present , it may make it easier . however , i believe it should be someone that is not invovled in this issue . perhaps another family member or a close family friend .", "parents have a difficult time understanding their child at times . hopefully , through this you all can become closer .", "i personally understand how difficult this can be . but if this works out . you can have a good family relationship and maintain a good relationship with your girlfriend . best of luck !", "well i can help you study if you 'd like ?", "what is your exam about ? plus you have a whole night to study !", "i have an idea , do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject ? if so , maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version .", "do n't worry i know you feel exhausted from studying all day , but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work . you do n't have much to lose , go ahead and give it a shot .", "i 'm sure you will do just fine , you can do it !", "well studies show that if you continuously think negatively , than that is how your life will be lived . but if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better . try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about", "yes , thats the spirit it works for me !", "okay is there anything else i can help you with or should i let you go ?", "yes , what is that ?", "yes i do actually . first make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best . next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings . take it easy and do not rush . just one", "great anything else ?", "okay it has been nice chatting with you , feel free to end the chat now , goodbye .", "hello , what brings you to bring the seeker ?", "i did not see it . what is your situation ? i am here to listen .", "i feel like dying all the time . it 's very common for people to be depressed . feel ashamed how ?", "so you are saying that you ca n't live regularly and people do n't understand that your mind is n't working in your favor . is that right ? can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy ?", "that sounds very hard . i can understand how judgmental people can be , and of course , why you would n't want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself . what do you do to cope ?", "that makes sense why you would want to avoid doing these things , which is a good thing , but is there anything that you try to do that is n't avoidance ? something that approaches something ?", "how do you feel about therapy ?", "that is unfortunate , but i understand . we have n't finished , the task , however , but i hope you feel better .", "okay , so can you tell me how frequently you sleep ?", "that sounds awful . i 'm sorry . have you tried researching or practicing any sleep hygiene ?", "smoking and drinking alcohol can cause sleep problems before bed . do you do those things ? what troubles your rest , you think ?", "it sucks it happens so close to the holidays . i understand it 's hard to accept but i 'd recommend talking with someone close to you like a friend and family member .", "i 'm sure someone will be there for you , they know you need them the most right now . if you do n't feel comfortable talking to them , you can seek online therapist . there are a lot of free service for mental car .", "it 's not gon na be easy , but at the same time not impossible . try looking at it a different way . you can use this time to train your skills or do things that you 've wanted to but did n't have the time .", "you can still travel domestically or just around your city . i like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind .", "that really sucks . do you have a garden at home ? in the mean time , try following youtube or other channels to work out , it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier . a healthy body is needed for a healthy mind .", "what have you been doing lately ?", "that 's a great idea , cooking and doing crafts can be helpful for you . instead of complaining with others , you can just invite them to join cooking with you , that way you can have companion .", "you can do video chat while cooking . i do virtual happy hour with my friends right now too .", "you too , i hope things get better for yourself .", "hello , how are you ?", "what help you need ? please can you explain .", "please do n't feel shame you can do it . nothing is hard if we try .", "so please try then you feel better . where you feel stuck in studies please can you explain .", "from today please feel yourself that you know everything about your studies , i think then you fell better .", "give more time to your study then you know everything about your studies .", "so start from today then tomorrow is better day .", "your welcome .", "i face this situation long time ago i try my best and then i come out easily because i try my best .", "hi ! what 's on your mind tonight ? .", "oh , i 'm sorry , that 's not fun at all , especially since you two have been friends for so long . have you tried reaching out to her by phone , email or social media ? .", "well , it 's a positive sign that she has n't blocked you completely . i agree , texting her each day could irritate her . that 's okay ! you should n't do anything that is n't fun or enjoyable or comfortable for either of you , in my opinion .", "it sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life .", "so you 're saying you feel hurt and depressed at not being able to make new friends easily in the pandemic , correct ? ahhhh. , ..... yes that ; s difficult , oh boy .", "for the time being we 're all stuck at home mostly , so maybe take some comfort in that in a strange way . heck i rarely see my friends - maybe once a year , so i know how that feels .", "on the bright side of things , at least you have a job . do you enjoy your job ? maybe start friendships with coworkers , possibly .", "how often do you get out for fresh air ? sure it 's not going to solve the lack of friends but it does help to clear your mind to go outside the next few months after work .", "yes , i agree with you , the warmer weather with the vaccine will probably speed up the end of all this . cabin fever is real .", "it 's really hard for people in our situation right now because there 's only so many virtual things to attend but maybe i just thought of a virtual cocktail hour , and you could go on facebook or even meetup . com or a free dating site to connect with other people in our situation who live near you", "hello . how can i help you today ?", "tell me about the situation that you are facing .", "i am sorry to hear that . how long have you been looking ?", "i understand that there are a lot of job loss in the covid time . is your job seeking related to that ? yeah it must be very difficult .", "i was applying for jobs for almost a year , and i got an offer in february right before coronavirus . i can definitely relate to you . i am glad that mechanical turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income . i am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family .", "i understand . do you have location requirements , for instance , you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the covid time ?", "i have been browsing job boards every now and then . there are consistently some grocery store jobs , or cashier jobs . if you do n't mind the location , i am sure you would be a good fit for these .", "i completely understand . i was looking for jobs for almost a year . i have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs i applied . maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied ( with an interview request , etc . ) i would suggest trying applying for jobs via linkedin , or google jobs . you can", "i hope i can be more helpful . i really sympathize with your situation . they would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis . in rare situations , they would hire `` temp - to - hire `` with the expectation of hiring temp workers .", "thank you for reaching out . it really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal . i hope you succeed .", "happy holidays and best wishes to you .", "have you tried the classified ads ? or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area ?", "i would suggest starting with one of those options .. do you have a resume ?", "i would suggest you type one up , most employers want an application and a resume .", "perhaps a friend can help you , if not they have programs on the web to help assist with that .", "have you been out of work for a while ? your welcome .", "are you saying you have been out of work for a while ?", "okay , are you saying your working from home ?", "then perhaps you should look for part time work .", "i am a little confused . are you looking for employment or not ?", "okay , in the mean time follow my advice . it will help . any other questions ?", "hi , what 's going on ?", "oooff that sounds brutal ... especially the excel part ! do you have a bigger screen you can use ?", "do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something ?", "the mute thing is horrible . i have no ideas for that . hahah . i 'm looking for help with that too ! yeah try the hdmi hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you do n't have the right connections .", "yeah if you stream it on your tv , you wo n't have to wear headphones ... that way you can control the volume better too .", "i 'm not really doing any distance learning right now . just working from home and coincidentally most of my work uses excel . i have constant virtual meetings where i have to show people things via excel . it 's pretty tough but i found if i use multiple monitors it makes things easier .", "my second monitor is not portable . i do n't know if that would work for me because i work better in one designated spot . so i have 3 monitors on my desk ( 2 separate monitors and my laptop screen ) . however something like that would definitely be something i 'd look into if i was in school", "i think that 's a good call ! do you think you can find a deal somewhere on it ?", "hi there , how are we doing today ?", "im doing great thanks . anything on your mind today ?", "and what do you mean by microcheating ?", "oh i see , well i think overthinking things like that can lead to unwanted emotions . or putting yourself in a situation with another person when you are in a relationship might mean there are other issues going on .", "well , if you are not talking to them then i see no harm . if you are talking to them with some sort of intention to for a relationship beyond friendship then i see issues arising .", "to never speak to your fiance ? if you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best .", "i think it might be as well if you can not control it . i do have to ask though , are you happy with your fiance ?", "then i 100 % back you on your decision . id take this time to focus on you too . strengthen the bond a bit .", "i thank you for opening up !", "i really wouldnt even consider it cheating to have feelings . acting on them or trying to strengthen them may be though .", "i see that , have you tried to talk to your friends about this issue ? or even try a therapist ? maybe you and your fiance can figure out more times to talk with facetime or zoom . do a virtual date night .", "i hope you do as well !", "hi , how 's things ?", "i am afraid that i am not able to see that .. can you tell me about it ?", "i can understand that - when i was sitting my final exams i constantly had nightmares about failing . nearly thirty years on and i still do ! ! but - you did really very well and you passed with an a. do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself ?", "it sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life , would i be right in thinking this ?", "have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism ? a therapist perhaps ? there is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling .", "does your school have any counsellors offering help for free ? many do . i believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too .", "really though i think that your problem is self esteem .. you should think better of yourself : ) i can tell that you set yourself a very high standard but i also think that you need to be kind to yourself .", "i can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life . have you tried to take anything to help ? i can recommend a hot milky drink before bed and perhaps a hot water bottle . anyway i hope that i have been able to be of some assistance to you ! have a lovely holiday season", "and you : ) remember to hit the quit button and take the survey ; )", "hi , how are you today ?", "i am doing well . whats bothering you ?", "oh no ! i am so sorry that has happened to you . that must feel like such a betrayal . can you tell me more about it ?", "dating can definitely complicate things .. oh my gosh ..... that is horrible . surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back .", "did you sign anything ? or have proof of what happened ?", "what was the business ? it depends on your location but i 'm sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent . or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose ?", "if you gave her a large amount of money and have any kind of messages about it i would look into trying to get it back .", "i would seek the advice of a lawyer . i 'm sorry this has happened thats horrible .", "i would say 80k is worth speaking to a lawyer about it . i 'm sorry you are so conflicted . i would not call the police because you willingly gave it to her . i would hire a lawyer to handle it .", "i would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all ....", "hey ! how are you ?", "what are these thoughts ? : )", "maybe your mind is just congested with the thoughts of life , and you just need to relax for a little while .", "a chemical thing , so maybe you need a counsellor , and then he can assess your problem , and everything will be alright : )", "yes , meditation is very good at calming down the mind . does it help you ? if it does maybe do it more continuously and more frequently .", "not constantly . because then you wo n't have anytime to do anything else , but if negative thoughts always come into your head , maybe try doing something you enjoy doing .", "yeah , maybe . but always look at the bright side of stuff and maybe the negative thoughts can stop .", "yes that 's the spirit ! and with that mind set good things will always come to you !", "yes , as long as you keep focused and not divert into any other thoughts : )", "i do it once a week and it really helps . i used to do it more often when i felt i could n't do anything right , so always do it according to the situation .", "i am sorry about that . it is always hard when we trust someone and they let us down . is that waht you are feeling ? disappointment in your friend ?", "i understand . i have been through a similar situation . was it a large amount of money ?", "oh , that is a very large amount of money . i can understand your being upset with them . have you talked to them about the money and returning it ?", "i see . it is a financially difficult time for us all . i am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately ? have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments ?", "were you speaking on the phone or in person ? is this a financial burden for you ? would you consider this person a good friend ? would you be sad if they were not in your life anymore ?", "that is very difficult . it is hard to judge things on the phone .", "i see . i am very sorry about that ! it is very difficult when a friend betrays your trust like that .", "it sounds like you are doing what you can . it is very nice of you to have been this patient .", "is the friendship more important than the money ? that is what it came down to for me .", "if you can not get her to meet with you , perhaps it might be time to seek advice from a lawyer ? that is providing that you are willing to possibly lose a friend .", "you are welcome . good luck ! i hope you find resolution and find a way to save your friendship !", "hello . how are you ? how may i help you today ?", "what is making you sad ?", "i can understand how you are feeling i had the same problem after i graduated .", "have you put in job applications everywhere .",

resume looking ?", "have you talked to someone in your family and see if they could help you with your resume to improve it .", "do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient .", "have you tried to go to place and talk to a hiring boss about a job ?", "yes i can understand that .", "all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon . yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen .", "your welcome hope my suggestions helped you today .", "you do the same and no problem : )", "hello , how are you doing and how was your night ?", "i 'm sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly , what you are saying is that you do n't have any job for a long time now .", "ok , that is a bit of relief . have u check for job vacancy in your state .", "oh , safety is everything . have you ever consider changing your location . i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well .", "wow , i pray that work out . i believe it will work out .", "wow , that 's a big deal . i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it .", "even by working there , you will surely meet new friends . do you know many people from the church ?", "you just have to be patient and do n't push it too hard so that you wo n't look desperate .", "wow , banquet at work . that is a wonderland stuff .", "that is definitely a dream job . god is everywhere . just put your trust in him . he never sleep nor slumber .", "wow ! olympic size pool . keep praying . the job is yours .", "that is good , i work in such place where everyone

misbehaving . how are you doing today ?", "where are you that you are able to be evicted ? you should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state . have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord ?", "well the plus side is they can not kick you out right now . have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement . have you tried applying for any job ? now is not the time for pride to get in the way , i would accept anything .", "i have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different . i am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass . i was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures . they could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet .", "your landlord . i worked out a way with payments when i was furloughed from my job . and yes i was actually homeless many years ago so i do know what it feels like to miss out on meals for a days at a time . it seems you should look up evictions during covid . they", "oh for my situation it was 100 % my fault i was in a bad place during that time . i spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me . bounced around shelters after i sold my car . washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems . may i ask what state you are", "i was going to paste a link for you on evictions during covid . please just google evictions during covid ( your state ) you will find groups that can help and the laws , that are on your side . i hope you can overcome this , i know you will .", "when it was happened .", "oh .. it 's really sad . but do n't worry . you can explain feelings to her . she may change her mind .", "i understand your feelings . if it is a true love , she will also understand your feelings .", "to escape from negative thoughts keep engaging yourself in your favorite work . listen to your favorite music .", "hello are you there ?", "hey how are you doing ? .", "doing fine , thank you ..", "what brings you here today ?", "that sounds difficult , would you like to elaborate on that ?", "that is completely understandable , there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now .", "most definitely , i 've also been feeling a bit overwhelmed by what 's going on . how have you been coping ?", "that is a good strategy , all the news outlets can be very overwhelming .", "what do you like to do to keep busy ?", "those sound like really good coping skills .", "that 's a personal choice you 're completely allowed to make . it sounds like you have a good foundation for building on your ability to cope .", "understandable . do you talk with a therapist or have someone you trust you like to talk to ?", "that 's great he is supportive . seeing an individual counselor or someone of the like can also be helpful . they 're there for just you and they have unbiased opinions . a lot are doing telehealth right now .", "you 're welcome , hopefully it can be helpful . i , myself , have used telehealth therapy recently and it 's just been helpful with all the unprecedented chaos going on this year .", "is there anything else you would like to talk about or that i can help you with today ?", "hi - how are you today ?", "i 'm sorry to hear that . what 's going on at work that 's making you upset ?", "oh no ! that can be very uncomfortable . are there reason you feel that way ?", "ugh - is he like this with everyone else , too - or do you think it 's just directed at you ?", "can you give an example and then maybe we can replay it a different way ?", "hmm = that is frustrating . can you sit with him and go over each section that he finds fault with and ask how he would have done it ?", "maybe talk to his secretary and make an appointment with him . do n't quit the job unless you have another one lined up ..", "she 's your first line to getting alone time with him ! she 'll get you an appointment for sure !", "good . i wish you the best of luck ! in the meantime it 's never bad to put out feelers ( discreetly ) for other jobs ..", "you 're welcome . make sure you bring a list of questions , too ! good luck ! enjoy the rest of the weekend .", "hi there ! how may i support you ?", "oh that is so hard . i have family that is n't taking covid seriously as well , and its so frustrating to see . are you able to talk to them about your concerns ?", "some people express their frustrations in certain ways . do you think there is another way to communicate with them ? it 's also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right .", "it sounds like you 're finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic , while you know it 's the safest option , with the social gatherings your friends are having . does that sound right ?", "that is such a hard position to be in . it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance .", "i have found that having vitural movie nights , or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected . is this something you think your friends would be willing to try ?", "i think a lot of people are going by the notion that you ca n't live your life in fear , and that they 're going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with covid . the stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged , for example , memorial day , 4th", "can you tell them that that just is n't the case ? you and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others . if i am correct , it has nothing to do with the fact that you do n't want to see your pals and family ! from chatting with you", "i hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you 're not seeing them .", "i know a lot of people that think the same thing . i have one friend who thought that , and they ended up contracting covid . thankfully she was ok , but after she got it she definitely did n't think it was a hoax anymore . i hope they understand the risk they are taking .", "i am proud of the choices you are making and i hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control . there is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled .", "yes of course , i hope this was helpful . you are doing the best you can and take pride in knowing that . : )", "hi . how 's it goin ' ? are you feeling troubled about something this morning ? i know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes . i have a lot of trouble with that myself .", "it sounds like you 're having some cash flow issues , right ? i can relate to that at a few more points in my life than i 'd points in my life than i 'd like to recall . it 's so very loving and sweet of you to be putting so much thought into the gift !", "it is pretty ridiculous how income does n't increase along with inflation / cost of living . very illogical and crippling to many of us financially . of course you 'll need to put your rent and utilities above all else , and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift ,", "i think that you will find out that all your parents really want is for you to be happy and to get to spend some quality family time with you . they love you and want you to be happy and healthy . that is a gift a lot of parents do n't get , surprisingly ..", "it may sound cheesy to you , , but making a gift for someone is still one of the best ways to tell someone how much you really care . you were willing to give of yourself and your valuable time to actually create a gift .", "hello , how are you doing ?", "is there anything you want to talk about ?", "yeah , i 've definitely felt that way ... especially during covid and having to adjust to working from home . what are some of the things in your routine during the day ?", "yep , for me it 's kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just `` take a break `` from grinding . mturk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy ... have you been doing a lot", "yeah it helps , just forcing yourself to have goals , for sure . i 've been determined to hit a number on mturk and exercise every time i 'm feeling tired , instead of taking a nap because my boss ca n't see me , lol . i would definitely say just start setting goals and try", "force yourself at first , then the `` body in motion , stays in motion `` law will take over . : ) all i know , is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together .", "one of the things i 've noticed about 2020 and i think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives ... you know before it would be like , `` i 'm looking forward to this concert , or this movie coming out next weekend. `` so , when you are n't planning", "i 'm sure it will be . definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the mturk hard , also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills .", "oh yeah , nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing . but , getting back in an active mindset helps . i used to love to have bonfires , it really was therapeutic for me but then i just lost the will to have them . since i 've been back on mturk and trying", "yep for sure , just get back at it and learn to love it again . anyways , good talking to you !", "hello , how are you ?", "that 's good . what is bothering you ?", "that is rough . the unemployment system has been very slow during covid , so i completely understand your frustration and worry . i am glad to hear that you are doing door dash , even if you are n't making a lot that is still something !", "i completely understand . i also wish mturk paid more , i feel like it takes a lot of time for not that much money . do you have a roommate , friend , or family member 's car you could possibly borrow instead of using your own ?", "i understand . are you still looking for and applying for jobs ?", "yes i am still here . when i started working from home i did a lot of research on different types of jobs that i could do from home . there are a lot of work options that are not necessarily well known , in my opinion , for online work .", "you 're welcome ! i hope i was somewhat helpful .", "hello .", "i am good how are you .", "how was your career path different ? i understand how you are feeling everything will be okay .", "she did not like your career path ?", "if anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right . it is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after .", "right but to be honest i would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that do n't support your career . i would just move on and let it go and focus on your self .", "right i can understand how you are feeling . we all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails . i have been in a situation like that .", "i just had to let it go and just focus on myself because i had no choice .", "no problem . merry christmas !", "thank you : )", "hai .", "how are you friend ? where are you from ?", "ok ,", "what are you doing ? i am john from , new york .", "oh nice .", "tell about you ? just i chating . what your good name ?", "wow good job ..", "anything else ?", "oh , do you most like that . ok care your child , give the best life .", "you hate anything do n't doing , this is your life , so make it perfect . very good i appreciate you , god bless you ..", "do n't think , you are good person .", "hello !", "i am doing great , how about you ?", "of course you can , tell me about it : )", "why so ?", "hey i 've been there too , but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things . you should try it !", "nothing special , just sit in my room in silence . listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate . they get me relaxed and motivated for the day : )", "that 's part of meditation ! i too worry while meditating , but when i 'm listening to the videos and following instructions all those worries go away : ) if that does n't help you , you can go out in nature to clear your mind off things . being in the wild really motivates me to", "meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead . and the wild ? that 's whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature : )", "please do ! you can try it with friends or alone . with friends can be a more fun experience while alone can be more spiritual or calming . i have tried both and both are amazing : )", "i 'm sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills .", "that is hard having so much pressure but i think you will be able to soon get employed again .", "it sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise .", "sometimes deep breaths help people calm down . have you tried that at all ?", "that can sometimes help you to regain your focus and be able to do more for yourself .", "also , job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers . have you tried any ?", "i sought out help from a recruiter online who helped me to find a job as well . have you heard of that option or tried it ?", "yes , i see that you seemed to be more relieved finding out these options . would you say these suggestions have been helpful ?", "from what i 've seen , people who can use some of these strategies like deep breathing and counseling they have felt some relief and could move forward better toward their goals .", "you are welcome . can i help you with anything else ?", "hello there , how are you ? .", "your relationship has ended ? i am very sorry about that . and your boyfriend ended it ? that was really wrong of him if you ask me . i think you might be better off without him .", "i have been in this position myself and i know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - i now have a great relationship !", "can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him ? how long were the two of you together ?", "he should not be treating you that way when you 've known one another so long !", "they all took his side ? not one took yours ?", "i tried to find some new interests . one thing i did was take a salsa class .. that was a great way to meet new people .", "i think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly .", "no you did not ! please do n't think like that .", "i think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated . i hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will . there are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this .", "i think you really need to take it one day at a time . things are very raw for you right now . there are some organisations that will offer a certain number of sessions for free .", "and yet here we are : p. therapy can be surprisingly beneficial , i have found .. i do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though . i know that i was .", "do you think that this might partly because your ex has eroded your self esteem ? .", "i can feel that you are starting to make progress already and are thinking of things that you can do post break up .", "you are most welcome . is there anything else you would like to talk to me about ?", "hello .", "how are you doing today ? do have anything on your mind ? oh i see , well we can talk about that if you like . has anything happened recently to make you feel this way ?", "it sounds like social isolation is really weighing on you ...", "human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal . so dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with you .", "you mentioned your friends feel the same way you do ... have you guys thought about making trying to do a zoom party ?", "i have a group of sister friends and we threw a zoom party . we scheduled it out and we decorated our own spaces and we made a spotify playlist that everyone contributed a song to and basically just had a video party . do you think your frinds may like to try that with you ?", "be creative ! get silly ! most important have fun ! this is a hard year but its still a chance to make happy memories . is there anything else on your mind ?", "lovely !", "bye friend ( : come back anytime if you ever wan na talk again !", "hello how are you doing today ?", "on no i am sorry to hear that ! i know that must be tough .", "yea that can be difficult . have you started looking for something else ?", "you could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way .", "or you could look for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things until you find something more permanent .", "yea it seems to be hard to get up with a lot of places at this time . persistent is the key .", "yes i understand right now is a very bad time to find anything with so many places closed . do you have any family or friends to reach out to for help if needed ?", "have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell ?", "i understand your concern there but it could help pay some as to help you not to get to far behind until you find something .", "if i were you i would call your friend maybe she has some suggestions of things you could do based off of your skills .", "yea and if not it wont have hurt to talk to her about it and all of the worry off your mind .", "it does not hurt to try . maybe call her and tell her you have some things on your mind and could use some advice from her if it is not to much of a bother ..", "hi there . how are you ?", "may i ask why you are feeling frustrated ?", "oh i understand how that could make you so frustrated , that would make me frustrated too . i am waiting to hear about my school .", "i am sure that whatever happens , you will do well with them . have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school ?", "that is all the more reason to be frustrated , i commend you for having to deal with that !", "have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors ?", "i understand why are you are worried though , that is a lot honestly .", "do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online ?", "i have seen that be the case for many people . hopefully your professors will be understanding with the switch .", "well i really hope that everything goes well for you ! you sound like you are prepared .", "of course ! i hope the rest of your year goes well .", "thank you !", "hello . academic work can be overwhelming at times . i am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles , though . could you tell me what the issue is in particular ?", "it is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming . make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can . when you feel capable of doing well on said exams , you will feel a lot less pressure .", "do you have an academic councelor you can talk to ?", "well at least is something . i am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief ..", "when i was at college , i usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday ( + homework ) and i also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time .", "i honestly did n't eat very healthy . if you live with your parents , i think a proper nutrition is easier . i usually slept around 7 hours each night . i picked most of my classes on the afternoon , worked out in the mornings .", "i would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve .", "of course , it is normal to feel upset . however , you should not blame yourself . no one is perfect .", "i am glad it does : d ! anything else i can help you with today ?", "you are very welcome !", "hello , how are you feeling ?", "you 're feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics - wise and you 're worried you wo n't be able to succeed . am i correct ?", "i know exactly how you 're feeling . i felt the same way until i made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot .", "i think it 's great you 're taking steps to try to help yourself . with a little more focus , i think you 'll be able to succeed !", "yes , apparently caffeine helps increase focus , as long as you do n't overdo it ..", "yes , i can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you .", "of course ! i find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable .. you can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation .", "yes , i struggl ed with focus but once i put my phone away , my focus increased a lot .", "of course ! is anything else on your mind ?", "yes , that sounds like a great idea . it sounds like you 're really trying to help yourself grow .", "yes , it 's true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood . i understand how you 're feeling , covid has affected me negatively as well but i 'm just trying to look at the bright side .", "yes , i would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress covid has on your brain .", "yes , i 'd recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything . at the moment , it 's all we could do .", "that 's great !", "that 's amazing , i 'm glad i could help put your mind at ease .", "of course , sometimes we all just need to talk to someone .", "alright , please reach out if you need to talk again ! thank you so much !", "good evening ! what can i help you with tonight ?", "that is extremely understandable . the pandemic is an event no one was prepared for , and it has cause unforseen upheavals .. that is a tough situation , being isolated physically from those that you love . i 'm sorry you 're going through that .", "are you at least able to maintain contact through text and video chats ? .", "well , i make sure i continue to maintain my relationships as well as possible through the avenues i have available . it is definitely not the same , but it 's what we have at the moment . personally , i try to maintain a routine . first hour after i wake up is coffee time , coffee and social media", "that sounds very stressful , i 'm sorry to hear that ..", "i definitely can not answer that . as long as people keep valuing one another though , we will get through it ..", "of course , that 's understandable ..", "hello , how are you ?", "so things have n't been going well at school . i think a lot of people are going through these days .", "i 'm sorry to hear that . that 's a heck of a situation to be in . is there anything you can do ? maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit ? or is the final grade a lock ?", "and the teacher would n't budge ?", "was this for a course that was required for a major ?", "ok , if you 're willing to give it one more shot , try to appeal the grade one more time . if that does n't work , you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it 's offered .", "i know what you mean . i failed a calc class once and i felt so empty inside . but i pulled myself together to take it again and passed it . i think you can do it too .", "exactly ! you 've got what it takes to make it through the difficulty , and your experiences so far will help you .", "you 're welcome . in the meantime , have a little relaxation time to ease your mind . thinking too much about the class would be stressful .", "i hear relaxing music and funny movies can do the trick .", "how are you feeling ?", "why do you feel depressed ?", "i once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner . staying active really helped me get over the relationship . through that activity i actually met my new partner !", "have you thought about doing something fun , like taking a trip somewhere ?", "it 's really difficult , but i know you can get through this ! what do you like to do for fun ?", "have you thought about fun activities you did without your partner ?", "what about before you met her ?", "what did you do for fun before you met her ?", "i loved doing that too ! have you thought about going out and doing that with your friends now ?", "good ! from talking to you i can tell that you have a lot of goodness in you !", "you are so welcome . i am so happy you are feeling better !", "i hope you have a great day .", "is there anything else you would like to talk about ?", "hello , how are you tonight ?", "i 'm doing well how can i help you tonight ?", "i can see where this would be frustrating . as parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy . have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you 'd wish they wear a mask ?", "i understand how you feel . can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they do n't honor your requests ?", "i can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation . before i share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue ?", "alright . have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less ? or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family ?", "we are going through some really tough times right now and i think that most people are very sympathetic . especially for those who are in your shoes . our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything . how do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until", "another suggestion that i have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile . i know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you 're keeping safe ! i 'm not sure of all the details on your job so i", "hello .", "i am tom . how can i help you ? how are you in need of assistance ?", "i have a real talent to provide guidance to people out there in the world . not doing well in college or high school ? are you in a trade school ? or in academia ?", "well , i went through a similar situation when a pink - eye breakout hurt my school .... i struggled financially , but took any job i could .....", "work part - time and go to school part - time .", "i suggest creating flyers and ask to be a dog walker . americans love their dogs . 70 percent of americans have dogs .", "i feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur ..... dog walking does n't take a lot of talent .", "how close in the library ?", "ok , that is good . i once worked at a library .", "i worked in a library many years .....", "it was quite pleasant . and the pay was decent . plus , i got to read and research a lot . i ended up meeting my wife at the library as well . i felt good taking the job . : )", "i suggest keeping an eye out for smart and sexy w = ladies who like going there .", "you can support your family by working at the library and reading up on higher paying jobs while there .", "i feel that the local libraries are great options for working and learning . i met my future wife while working at the library many moons ago . do you have any other questions or concerns ?", "hello , how are you feeling today ?", "i am sorry to hear that , i can understand when we think we want something and then we change our mind but it 's too late .", "nobody knows him better than you do , right now i do not think he is in a good place either since it was n't his choice to end it , how do you think he would react if you started pressuring him ? .", "frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this , perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel , without pressuring him into a response .", "you can always ask him calmly if he would like to talk , so you both have a chance to express your feelings in a safe way , with no yelling or arguing , do you think that 's something he would do ?", "nobody likes to see that one 's friend is sad because of someone else , i think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve , if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well , but you need to make sure you want him back .", "what made you like someone else in the first place ?", "was it a common thing that he did n't give you the attention you wanted ?", "were you happy with him or were you happy that you were with the popular guy ?", "it sounds to me like you liked the title more than the feeling of being with him , reflecting on your time together , would you do that again ?", "popularity in my opinion , it 's just an opinion ( i hope i make sense ) but think about how you 'd like to be treated and how you want to feel when you are with someone , because at the end of the day it 's your feelings and your happiness , i wish you the best", "i am sorry for my late reply , i did not hear the chat go off . ive actually had that same situation happen to me before .", "yeah i can tell you something you might not want to hear but it ended with us ending our friendship on that level .", "i didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years . we still hang out but it isnt like it was before . people move on to others and it hurts . they usually are not trying to hurt us though .", "everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh .", "good , im glad you can realize that ! some people cant .", "great , any ideas on what you would like to focus on ?", "those are great ideas actually , when i want some me time , i usually go for a nice long hike or run .", "great , i just want you to know that your friend moving to a different person is not your fault . its an unfortunate side of life .", "hello . how are you doing today ?", "how can i help you ?", "it sounds like you are having some difficulty at school , i have definitely been there .", "yes i worked a dead end job for ages when i was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck .", "i am going to be honest a little luck was involved i managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work .", "i would say so i am an insurance broker , it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up . you can find something too .", "can you give me some more details ?", "that is completely understandable .", "i have you a few , there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit .", "indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs , honestly i would suggest looking at jobs that you normally would n't and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online .", "yes i think that is a great idea , look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers .", "i used it a bit , i mainly used indeed .", "yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important .", "coursera has a lot of great courses , it really depends on what you are looking for .", "is that what you are going to school for ?", "what year are you in ? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job .", "honestly you seem like you are pretty on top of this i do n't think you will have any issues finding a job .", "yes that is fair enough , how much time do you have until your exam ?", "while that is plenty of time to get some studying done : )", "honestly i find that if you are going for the test right away i always like to just breath and relax a bit .", "you seem like you know what you are doing , i think you will do just fine .", "i am so sorry for hearing that . do you want to talk more detail about that ?", "you seem really focus on just one person . life is rich . think about other important people in your life such as parents , friends .", "yes of course you should take your time as long as you want and you can do it , one day you can leave all those problem .", "also do exercise , yoga , workout , talk your friends , listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot . whatever works for you , you 'll try them out . just chatting with you , you seem very a smart , strong girl . do not be upset about things you ca n't control .", "for sure , what else we need to talk about ?", "i feel the same way .", "kinda ok , but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy .", "not sure , i can cook myself however the situation pushes me unhealthy choice somehow lol . btw , it helps for your current mood , does not it ? i mean we are talking about other stuffs which make you think about your problem less ?", "hello . how are you tonight ?", "i 'm sorry to hear that . what has you feeling depressed ?", "i understand , but just to make sure i know what is going on fully , you are depressed in general and do n't know how to get through it ..", "just from these few messages , i can tell you are extremely upset about this .. i have had problems in the past with depression as well , i used to have severe anxiety as well ..", "it was tough . have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue ? i did when i was going through my depression and it really helped ..", "i did n't like the meds that they gave me either , however i felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal ..", "it was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on . it allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed ..", "have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things ?", "why did you stop playing insturments ?", "how are you feeling today ?", "it seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now . i 'm also a bit tired but doing ok. what 's been on your mind recently ?", "it seems like a stressful time to be in college . how have you been coping with everything going on ?", "i also like hip hop and r & b. it 's too bad we are n't able to go to any live music events for a

angry now ? what happened dear ?", "can you tell me what happened so that i can understand ?", "it 's ok dear . did you asked him why he did that ?", "just remember , yesterday is gone . there is really nothing you can do about the situation . you better keep your distance from that particular person .", "learn from your mistake and do n't do it again dear .", "yeah . we ca n't control others . right ?", "yes . it totally depends on how mature the person is . just forgive him and keep in mind for next time whether you should share something with him or not .", "yes . let it go and do n't confuse it again . trust me . you became stronger by this .", "yes . do n't think much and sleep soon dear .", "i am happy to hear this dear .", "welcome dear .", "you too dear .", "yeah . do you want to talk about something else ?", "bye then .", "hi , how are you today ?", "i am sorry to hear that , would you like to talk about what is bothering you ?", "it sounds like your feelings are hurt over a misunderstanding you had with a friend is this correct ?", "i see i am sorry that it has you feeling down , did you try to talk with your friend to see if you could resolve your feelings ?", "maybe you could send him a message on social media and let him know the argument has your feelings hurt and you would like to try to talk about it when he has time .", "how long have you been friends with him ?", "oh yea that can make things difficult , but i think if you keep reaching out you may could talk this over . did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true ?", "i would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her . if that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if", "i would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much . do you have any hobbies ?", "maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it .", "from chatting with you seem like a nice person , try not to let it get you down .", "i am glad i could be of some help !", "you are welcome .", "bye .", "i am here . how are you ? i feel that i can really help you on this christmas night .", "how long have

are allergic to incenses of all kinds ?", "there are websites like decompress dot org that can help with relationships that are in turmoil .", "i used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships .", "i feel obligated to help during christmas because i had a nasty fight with my partner one year over gifts .", "what was the fight over ? food ? money ? sex ?", "i would let things decompress for a long while .", "i suggest thinking through ending the relationship if he has a hot temper ..", "yes , just think it through for some time ..", "was the relationship with him pleasant for many months ?", "you said it has only gotten rough in the last two months ?", "you said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on christmas ? today , you mean ?", "in my opinion , i would consider accepting that it is not going to be a healthy relationship whatsoever .", "i have seen things only get worse in a situation like yours . i think h needs to accept that he needs to grow up . how old are the both of you ? any other counseling that i can give ?", "good afternoon . how are you ?", "oh no . i am sorry

company to secure you a job or can you come back to work later if you get lay off ?", "can you talk to your boss possibly and let him know you could do other job to help your boss so that you wo n't get laid off ?", "i see . if it is really likely to happen , i would brush up my resume , make it stand out , but job search can be really stressful .", "i see . startimg your own business is something that could help . what do you think ? totally agree .", "yes , for example teaching something doesnt need much capital . i am trying to become some online tutor at some point . what do you think ?", "hi ! how are you doing today >", "whats been the weirdest part of the pandemic for you ?", "hmm , tell me more . what do you think is going on ?", "living together can make people more comfortable with each other . has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them >", "i hear you . have you said anything to either one of them ?", "having doubts about relationships is rough . do you know brene brown ?", "she researches shame and vunerability .", "she has a great ted talk !", "anyway , i find her imspirational when i have doubts . no , not really it

for everyone right now . emotions are running high , covid is running rampant , it 's a mess and understandable that we are all stressed .", "please stay safe and communicate with your roommates .", "i 'm sorry to hear that , is there a particular reason or instance for you feeling this way ?", "yes that is a very tough situation , covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world . there may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future , maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available .", "i understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress . have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry ? during this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services , there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their", "well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer . is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city ?", "well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works , hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside . is there anything else you would like to talk about ?", "i think your exactly right , human contact is now a premium and i 'm sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to . missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others . take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see", "your welcome stay strong .", "thank you .", "hey . how are you ?", "why not ?", "how have you been able to get by ?", "if you keep trying things will work out in the end .", "perhaps you havent searched well enough , have you gone to many interviews ?", "perhaps on the interviews you are doing something wrong , because it have been a while .", "dont think that . you are worthy , you just need to apply yourself in the right direction : )", "perhaps look for any job for now , even if they wage is n't good , because you have to start with something . you need some work experience .", "it happens that you get rejected , but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again : )", "try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation

are never easy .", "well , if the break up is still fresh , it will take some time before you start feeling yourself again . breaking up with someone can be as devastating as a death . because you mourn the loss of the person . what do you think you could do to help yourself feel better ?", "what kind of hobbies do you have ? or are you involved in sports or any type of other activities that you enjoy ?", "that could be a great distraction . you could start practicing soccer again . you definitely have more time for it now . do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up ? sometimes talking with a close friend or family member can help a lot too .", "why do you say that ? are you focused on trying to get back with them ?", "that is difficult . what caused the break up ? was it mutual ? or was it one sided ?", "ok , so your ex broke up with you . did they give you a reason why ? or did they just say it 's over and that was it ?", "oh that is a hard one . i had a boyfriend and he cheated on me with another girl and he broke up with me because i would not do things with him that i was uncomfortable with . what do you think you could do to change your mindset ? i know for me , writing helps a lot .", "hi there , how are you feeling today ?", "i did not see that , i am sorry . do you want to talk about it ? it might help .", "is it affecting your work or your home life ?", "can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently ? for instance , i had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and i was mortified .", "that sounds bad . have you considered you might be suffering from depression ?", "you sound quite lethargic . i think you should see a gp ?", "do you feel as though life is hopeless and there is no way forward ?", "well that is something : ) what are you looking forward to ?", "what sort of goals have you set for yourself ?", "well that sounds very creative ! you should definitely publish .", "no no do it now . you might have written a best seller and not know it .", "you are more than welcome . i hope you feel a little reassured now .", "okay , can you press quit first as i am not able to do that from my end : ) . we ca n't end the hit till you press quit and take the survey : )", "hello , what is on your mind today ?", "that is really tough . a lot of people are going through that , you are not alone . what kind of business do you have ?", "christmas is right around the corner though , and it is almost the 15th . military get paid the 1st and 15th so there is still hope for a christmas rush ! tax season is right around the corner too ... there is defineately still reason to keep hope .", "are you online or in store ?", "thats great then , online businesses are less likely to fail . you know , i am in construction and there are soo many zoom meetings . honestly , i was in an office with 4 people and hardly wore make up . now with all these meetings i amd doing meetings constantly and i have had to start wearing more", "also , i think it depends on where you are in the world . covid hit my area really hard around april / may , but things are completely back to normal now . people hardly wear masks , stores are open , it just takes time .", "i think you will be fine . you are resourceful , you are supplementing income with mturk , thats awesome . you seem to have a good head on your shoulders ."]
