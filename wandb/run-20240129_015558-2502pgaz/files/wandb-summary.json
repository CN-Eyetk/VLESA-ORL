Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already. That is a really good indicator.", "I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try?", "I' m doing fine, how are you?", "Also, job counselors may help at employment agencies to match you with potential employers.

Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard.

Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city?", "it' s true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online?", "Yes, if you are doing longer videos, I recommend YouTube.

It is hard to see her\" move on\", but you will do the same. covid has changed the environments to meet people though, and all I can suggest is to be patient. The world will get back to normal. and you will too..", "I agree. You are not alone.", "Well you' re resourceful at staying warm, at least.

Are you comfortable talking about that night?", "yes it' s the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones.", "Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help.

May i ask what state you are in?", "I hope that she does the right thing and that you can stay friends. Good luck to you.", "That is a totally normal aspect of human nature.

Not one took yours?", "Mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight. Do you think that, you can try something like this?", "How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay.", "I loved doing that too! Have you thought about going out and doing that with your friends now?", "Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back!", "Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that?", "It sounds like you' re sticking close to your friend, although it doesn' t feel like its helping. It' s my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn' t always an option. The most important thing you can do for her is just to be there for her and allow her to feel however she needs to feel right now.", "Have you googled images for short curly hairstyles?", "How have you been able to get by?", "yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out.", "That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming.", "If you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him.

Many do. I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too.", "yes. it totally depends on how mature the person is. just forgive him and keep in mind for next time whether you should share something with him or not.", "Those sound like really good coping skills.", "Well, I hope that I have been able to offer some useful suggestions. Do you feel a bit better about things now?", "Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward.", "So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety?

Do you mind me asking what happened?", "I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though.", "I would be subtle about that tactic.. If you haven' t met any of his school mates. I wouldn' t pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates?", "It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently?", "I am Tom.

I know it' s going to be tough but I believe you can get past this.", "Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally?", "Hi there! How may I support you?", "The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life.", "frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response.", "Have you explained to him your reasoning?

How are you today?", "Is it affecting your work or your home life?", "Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you?", "Ok. I am happy to listen..", "I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is\" bad news\"?", "You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed?", "You are welcome. Can I help you with anything else?", "How long have you not been feeling not so well?", "well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?", "i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you!", "I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin?", "Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long?", "even so you may be able to refer this situation for review to a financial regulator.", "That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do.", "Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self.", "it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.", "oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it?", "What about online classes that enable you to study and work also.", "What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!", "Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on.", "I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly.", "You' re welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful.", "I also talked to a few friends who are married and had experienced infidelity. They chose to forgive each other. I learned a lot from them. It helped me to make up my own mind as to how I needed to move forward. I didn't want to use a therapist since I do better with discussing ideas with multiple people. But ultimately you may experience a lot of ups and downs. That is also normal. It is your mind and heart processing everything. Please do not get discouraged.", "I read different postings and have over 30 followers.", "things are weird for everyone right now. emotions are running high, covid is running rampant, it' s a mess and understandable that we are all stressed.", "What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?.", "Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe.", "That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won' t be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home.", "Thank you for reaching out. It really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal. I hope you succeed.", "So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,.", "It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. Maybe you can write that on your list - - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends. I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years, it isn' t easy, but it' s part of maturing in life.", "I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc?

I can' t help you if you don' t talk to me darling'", "popularity in my opinion, it' s just an opinion( I hope I make sense) but think about how you' d like to be treated and how you want to feel when you are with someone, because at the end of the day it' s your feelings and your happiness, I wish you the best of luck.", "So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before?", "I just decided.", "how are you?", "thats hard,.. but you can do it.", "yes.... but my recycling pile has gottene out of hand with amazon boxes. oops lol.", "Think positive my dear friend.

Get silly! most important have fun! this is a hard year but its still a chance to make happy memories. Is there anything else on your mind?", "Great ideas! Is there anything else I can help you with?", "bye...", "Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things?", "That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband.", "That' s pretty tough. You' re like the 3rd person today who have been going through this,", "Hello, how are you doing today?", "Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice.", "They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc.", "What did she say when you broke up?", "Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/ weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well.", "Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online?", "I' ve had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It' s difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment.", "It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right?", "I couldn' t agree more. We will get through this with each others help.", "Just never give up. Two years will go by quickly if you keep attending. Look for grants that will assist you.", "maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it.", "Maybe it can be a good opportunity for her to change her lifestyle and get off the drugs. On that note, I hope I have been able to give you some reassurance and thanks for talking!", "Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns?", "Are they okay with it when you decline?", "So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to?", "I am glad I was able to help!", "Most welcome! Can you press quit first as alas I can' t do it from my end till you have.", "My I suggestion you pick your closest friend, and talk to her/ him about your feeling, but not about your boyfriend, about how you feel your friends have been treating you. Be nice but firm. I bet once they hear your pain, they will be very supportive.", "May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family.", "No problem. Merry Christmas!", "Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed.", "if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help.", "do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better?", "You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me.", "I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won' t get so bad that I can' t remember what it felt like to be a bit happy.", "yeah I could understand your feelings right now.", "Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed??", "What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest.", "That' s a great idea! Just remember to be kind to yourself and take breaks when you need to! Aw, I' m glad!", "I know how you are feeling about that.", "stay strong and stay safe.", "I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.", "I enjoyed chatting with you. Take care.", "I see that, have you tried to talk to your friends about this issue? Or even try a therapist? Maybe you and your Fiance can figure out more times to talk with facetime or zoom. Do a virtual date night.", "I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you!", "Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job?", "You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are.

Is there any other reasons your parents dissaporve of her?", "I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.", "For sure, what else we need to talk about?", "That is reasonable. And it sounds like you are doing all you can. Could you teach from home online and keep yourself safe? Or perhaps provide your son financial support?", "Please do!

I struggled financially, but took any job I could.....", "Have you talked to him recently?", "Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.", "I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened?", "It is natural to feel sad when someone you care about dies.", "That is rough, both for you and him.

From speaking with you, it seems like you are caring and hardworking.", "And you:) remember to hit the quit button and take the survey;)", "Honestly, its not anyone else' s business. IF you' re suspicions are in fact correct, then you' ve got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart - breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she' s cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o= is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she' s cheating?", "EXACTLY! You deserve so much better! Make yourself feel like it and everyone see it!: D: D.", "That' s a tough one. I personally still struggle with sleep for other reasons. Some things that can help is taking melatonin 30 minutes before bed. I have also had some luck with white noise machines or other soothing sound machines.

Stories of real people are inspiring.", "I can see why that would upset you though. Did something happen?", "I' m sorry that you' re having to deal with such stressful circumstances.

It' s scary for everyone at this point.", "Hi there. Yes, What is making you sad?", "Of course, sometimes we all just need to talk to someone.", "Ignoring this will NOT help things.

Do you get paid vacation time in your job?", "I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times.", "Not at all.", "What brings you here today?", "I' ve dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self - respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it.", "I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you?", "Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can' t change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace.", "What is your age?", "Of course. These things are tough to face on your own, so you did the right thing by reaching out. I know you want to be there for your friend as much as possible, and I think that will help you to move through grief at the same time, but just be mindful to not overextend yourself too much. You have to be there for yourself too.", "Could you try something like Facebook or Instagram to connect with old friends or acquaintances?", "I' ve been there too. Expecially with covid, it can be hard realiing you may be alone and it may be frusterating dating someone new. if you really love someone, shouldnt they love you back? did his actions show love?", "You' re welcome, hopefully it can be helpful.

When did this happen?", "You can draw unemployment and disability.", "can you tell me how are you before this incident?", "Have you talked since then?", "Of course!! managers are erally helpful. I had a similar sitation with a coworker two years ago and the head of my group really helped me clear it up.", "You have a good day as well!.", "Well yes fair point! Us poorer people are not doing very well though! Have you tried to talk with any of your coworkers about this? I would suggest that it might help.", "How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him?", "Very little to complain about today. What brings you here?", "You as well.

However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself.", "Hello. How are you tonight?", "Thanks! What is going on in your neck of the woods?", "Was this for a course that was required for a major?", "I don' t think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around.", "haha.", "You could also tell a teacher what is happening.

It helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective.", "no, don' t be like that you know you have to love youself.", "Thank you for allowing us to complete this task as well. I know depression can cause us to lose motivation, so I really appreciate it. I hope you feel better.", "Oh I am sorry to hear that. Have you had a conversation with her about her actions and how they have made you feel?", "Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you are feeling?", "Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. You can get comfortable with them before you hangout:)", "nothing better than the outdoors wit h some friends. Fresh air can really clear the mind.", "Okay. One thing - - Would it be all right if I write you a Christmas card? If you would rather not give out your name/ address, I totally understand.", "That is understandable. I know how you feel, may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel?", "I am doing well. Whats bothering you?", "Yea i feel so bad for her. Thing is so presents arent everythign. Since you got little ones might be time for some new traditions. Make some\" igloo\" forts and have an indoor snowball fight with balled of socks or something like that.", "There' s nothing that can prepare you for unexpected tragedies like this. We just have to deal with them as they come.", "Doing little things every day.", "Of course, that' s understandable..", "very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol. My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can' t get stuck in them.", "I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven' t already done so.", "I can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life. Have you tried to take anything to help? I can recommend a hot milky drink before bed and perhaps a hot water bottle. Anyway I hope that I have been able to be of some assistance to you!

Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though.", "and make sure you are not hard on yourself. you' re getting by. you' re hanging in there. you are doing well under the circumstances.", "You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding?", "Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies?", "they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great.", "You both can go for a date or do the things what your partner like. Drinking is luring so stay away from that and you can do it.", "One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid?", "I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too!", "Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.", "have you put in job applications everywhere.", "yes you can do it. just try.", "I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities.", "I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable.", "Exactly! You' ve got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you.", "Family comes first. I would do anything to save my marriage as you are doing. I am proud of you. I am pretty sure you both love each other more than anything.", "Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened?", "Hello, what can I help you with today?", "Well, I love fictions and mystery. Right now I just finished\" The Davinci Code\".", "so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.", "Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews?", "Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing!", "if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart.", "do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient.", "That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression?", "That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand.", "Same here, wish I could' ve been more helpful but we' re in similar situations and nothing else came to my mind. Hang in there, you' re doing great under the circumstances!", "Is she able to support herself financially?", "I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up?", "you dont have to meet a lot of people, but atleast one or two of your friends with all the safety measures? who could really help you, and also one of the best solution can be group studies as well. My pleasure dear friend.", "I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having?", "This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them.", "That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident?", "You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP?", "I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship!", "I understand that! it is very reasonable to want to be around family and friends during the holidays.", "I Know that in the beginning it' s so difficult to do anything, you just want to sleep and do nothing, but with time you' ll feel much better and try start over.", "I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance..", "I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?", "They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later.", "How long are you doing the online school?", "Having no support is so hard:( Especially during these times!", "its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps. is there anytihng else you want to talk about?", "Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective.", "I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup?", "your welcome have a good evening to.", "Doing fine, thank you..", "Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU.", "You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee.", "How are you tonight?.", "If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after.", "okay, can you press quit first as I am not able to do that from my end:). We can' t end the HIT till you press quit and take the survey:)", "Courage is not the absence of the fear, you should fight to find your place.", "Sounds great. I' m glad you didn' t give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better.", "I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being?", "oh that' s nice. youre welcome!", "You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there.", "Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week.", "I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you.", "I can understand that. I am sorry. Was it different when your children were younger? What has changed?", "Anything particular got you down? Hello.", "Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex.", "Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.", "So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single..", "That is understandable. Was it because of the virus.", "You' re welcome!", "oh sorry for misunderstanding you.", "Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now.", "As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it.", "I know what I am after, just have to be persistent. That is a good choice of study.", "Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people.", "Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot!", "Hello! How are you doing?", "Ha, well after two years, feelings had to have changed. Even a little. Does he live nearby?", "that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind.", "I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:(", "That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend?", "Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.", "Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them?", "I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how?", "I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings.", "It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?", "Im hope that i have been able to help at least a little bit.", "Hi, how are you feeling today?", "I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry!", "you can call the store and see if they have anything written by your favorite author.", "I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet.", "Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation.", "If you need anything later, just text me.", "Take care!", "Hey, how are you today?", "I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this.", "Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.", "Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?", "i face this situation long time ago i try my best and then i come out easily because i try my best.", "I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money.", "It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct?", "exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year?", "It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything?", "Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation.", "I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....", "It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right?", "So you have lost some books? Were they important to you?", "So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.", "Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.", "When did this fear start?", "That is why I am here. Is there anything else you would like to chat about?", "Can you tell me more about the fight?", "tell about you? just i chating. what your good name?", "Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends?", "Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression?", "Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.", "It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end.", "Work part - time and go to school part - time.", "In what way does it do that?", "I' m doing good today. What brings you on here?", "I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here!", "Medium only cost 5 a month and you can make money writing about what you have experienced.", "You' re welcome. I wish you the best and many blessings.", "Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but Im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place.", "I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?", "I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic.", "I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest.", "Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?.", "Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods?", "of course! I hope the rest of your year goes well.", "I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you' ll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet. You don' t want to be with a cheater. you should want to be with someone who respects you and treats you well.", "Just stick to the plan. Spend more time together. Cook dinner for her. Make a strong bond and my best wishes are there for you.", "Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.", "get yourself fixed up and cute, and find a hot new guy. your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy. its quite theraputic: D", "I would suggest starting with one of those options.. do you have a resume?", "Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped!", "I can understand.", "I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective.", "Those are completely valid feelings to have at this time. Have you considered getting a small reminder of your cat perhaps a small shrine or tribute to him/ her? Her I apologize for the confusion.", "Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run.", "Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting?", "Just have the confidence within yourselves and believe in YOU, that is the most important thing. Stop worrying, and think about what can make it better.", "Don' t get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.", "Any improvement is still improvement!", "I use Medium and now I also have another account with them called Patreon.", "I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before.", "I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships.", "Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this.", "yes i can understand that.", "oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together?", "Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you.", "It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are?", "Thank you:)", "Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn' t make you selfish at all.", "What types of things was she texting him about?", "Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown.", "Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together?", "Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?", "How bad were you injured.", "Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.", "What age are You?", "Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask)", "have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.", "I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version.", "i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties.", "Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life?", "Thanks for sharing!", "Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/", "i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors?", "There is actually 4 or 5 different marketing brands with Medium. What is your main thing to write about besides movies.", "Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh.", "I thank you for opening up!", "I' ve worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co - workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn' t be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth.", "you know any other self work?", "Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do?", "Have you tried the classified ads? Or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area?", "i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference.", "I feel the same way. I hope you can get things on better terms.", "I understand that completely, I can relate a lot.", "You can end the chat safely now.", "What are you doing? i am john from, new york.", "Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on. That' s good that they don' t push you too much. Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions. I' m sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help... sober fun! Also if you find that you' re struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support. Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking. Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others.", "HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays! If you spend a few hours a day. i' m sure that you' ll find one in no time!!", "Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back.", "Hello, how can i help you today?", "I think if you make some time for yourself and talk to your friends you' ll feel a bit better even though it sucks. I hear you, I' ve had to start over again lots of times. but the right guy is out there. Just imagine how bad it would have been if you found out after you moved in with him. You dodged a bullet! are you still there? Hello?", "So everyone' s plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit' s going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable..", "I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.", "Do you have a husband or bf?", "It sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way.", "That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks?", "one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps? oh thankyou.... had my shot yesterday.... now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire( May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go.", "Kinda Ok, but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy.", "you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID?", "What brings you here today?", "At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic.

How are you?", "It sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you. You just need a better work/ life balance to straighten things out. I had a similar experience in the past, and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me.", "I' m sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.", "I do know how a programming job can take away from some social aspects of your life, maybe try and go to a bar, or somewhere social to get out some. No problem, I hope I have helped you some. Happy Holidays!", "Do you want to talk about it?", "Thank you.. you know you are not alone in such journey...", "I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work.", "Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this.", "Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important.", "I started going to college in 94 and still going.", "That could be a great distraction. You could start practicing soccer again. You definitely have more time for it now. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up? Sometimes talking with a close friend or family member can help a lot too.", "Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today?", "Do you think you both might be open to talking to a marriage counselor?", "Is the patient a ward of the state.", "It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life.", "That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you?", "That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now.", "It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through.", "Well, can you tell me about it anyway? I am happy to listen.

Were you together a long time?", "I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family.", "Got you.. try to form a group on - line with the people you know.. at least until this CONVID thing is over..", "I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too.", "That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this.", "I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware.", "Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off?", "Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights. Have you tried to look into things like that yourself?", "There is some very lucrative stuff out there:). Take what we are doing right now for instance.", "hope you feel better.", "Calm down friend.", "How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is?", "That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively. You can use this as a time to reconnect with family and to get your resume together.", "I' m sure you will find something suitable if you keep trying.", "Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self - manage without the right resources.", "Many have found meditation helps relieve anxiety. Most importantly, if you find yourself feeling depressed or worsening symptoms, please contact your medical professional.", "Your welcome.", "You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use.", "That would not make it acceptable though!", "So from what I understand, you caught your significant other texting someone else..", "bye.( you need to quit first..

There are so many people going through this right now.", "I' ve never used it, not sure if Tinder is the right place to meet someone to spend time with. Not always the best intentions.", "I see. What is your wind - down routine like in the evening, if you have one?", "Really though I think that your problem is self esteem.. you should think better of yourself:) I can tell that you set yourself a very high standard but I also think that you need to be kind to yourself.", "it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now.", "I have been through this, I learned how to keep myself busy and do things that I enjoy to occupy my mind and let time heal those wounds.", "have you been sleeping mostly during the day, or at night?", "That sounds very stressful, I' m sorry to hear that..", "Exactly, keep calm and relax. Avoid any negative vibes. Aim is to distress yourself.", "hello, how are you doing and how was your night?", "You definitely need to eat and sleep even though you don' t feel like it.

I don' t know what that really means but I think it has something to do with being able to get guys easily.", "Thats good the more time you have to devote the better!", "How are you doing today? Do have anything on your mind? Oh i see, well we can talk about that if you like. Has anything happened recently to make you feel this way?", "that' s great!", "Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all?", "Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing.", "God, tell me more, lol.", "It can seem hopeless right now, but think about how you felt when you were in a better position.", "People are not always who they say they are.", "The mute thing is horrible.

It help me a lot.", "Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries?", "The job of the therapist isn' t to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It' s to help you understand your feelings and better cope. That' s why they are so great!", "You are welcome and everybody is rooting for you.", "Happy holidays and best wishes to you.", "Of course but having them by your side is a gift. your welcome. I wish I could help a little.", "Ohh.. sorry to hear that.

We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted.

Can you tell me more?", "Yes just a moment.", "Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens?

You seem like a good persn.", "If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX( which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing.

But things will improve, keep communication with your family for now and when the time is right in Virginia you can start to look for new friends to spend time with in your new home.", "Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him.", "no problem. stay safe.", "Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding.", "like working out? it will give you a lot of benefits especially with your health. you can do it!", "I understand being angry about that. Going to school supposedly is/ was a way to take control of one' s life, it' s no longer the guarantee is once was.. I sometimes feel a similar way about my own classes. I am also in my thirties.. But I personally enjoy learning, and would always regret it if I never finished my degree. We all have our cultural norms that we conform to, whether consciously or unconsciously. Do you find yourself being stymied at the application level or the interview level when it comes to jobs?. Maybe having a professional in your career path review your resume would be helpful.", "Goodbye.", "Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right? It sometimes helps me to feel that we' re all in this together. And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever!", "I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you.", "Is the friendship more important than the money? That is what it came down to for me.", "have you talked to anyone about it.", "Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on?", "Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about?", "Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style.", "No, but I' m sure that there is a fitness club or city pool where you all can share your skills.", "I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred.", "You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting.

Are you working or on layoff.", "Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I' ve been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn' t because we grow out of them, it' s quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.", "you too.", "I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner!", "Of course!

Talk to me, what' s happening?", "hello. you feel sad, why?", "It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress.", "I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious. Do you know what is causing you to feel that way?", "I feel sorry for you.. What was the reason behind that? I understand how you are feeling right now.", "fantastic! that' s a great way to spend your time.", "that' s a great idea, cooking and doing crafts can be helpful for you. Instead of complaining with others, you can just invite them to join cooking with you, that way you can have companion.", "You' ve got this! It' s easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow.", "I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you?", "Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis?", "she has a great TED talk!", "You' re welcome:) I have a solution for every problem you know;)", "I have been attending school online, and I occasionally make deliveries for my husband and I' s small business..", "Deep breaths and practicing mindfulness will help you relieve some stress.", "I do it once a week and it really helps.

I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect?", "also, i think it depends on where you are in the world. covid hit my area really hard around april/ may, but things are completely back to normal now. people hardly wear masks, stores are open, it just takes time.", "ok, don' t worry friend,", "LOL if only everyone had that thought process.

What caused the break up? Was it mutual? Or was it one sided?", "Well I am happy to listen to any problems that you have.", "Remember to always keep a positive mindset.

Where do you live.", "how are you? what' s new with you?", "Where are you that you are able to be evicted? You should not be able to be evicted from your home during this time in pretty much every state. Have you tried contacting anyone for help other than your landlord?", "we all face different pressure and have to find ways around it.", "Yes, giving them a helping hand, getting things done together, could greatly improve your home life.

That at least can help you financially until you get a new job.", "I think the best way is to move on.", "Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work.", "Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep... the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more?", "I personally understand how difficult this can be. But if this works out. You can have a good family relationship and maintain a good relationship with your girlfriend. Best of luck!", "Yes! Making lists can be a great idea and help organize some thoughts and ideas you have in your head.", "But what about the family?", "Anytime! It was nice meeting you. Bye - now.", "It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you?

Anything specific?.", "Ah and then they started rolling in, correct?", "I am hoping you will find the right solution.", "it' s ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time.", "I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me.

I realise it' s a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though.", "How do you feel about therapy?", "not sure, i can cook myself however the situation pushes me unhealthy choice somehow lol. Btw, it helps for your current mood, does not it? I mean we are talking about other stuffs which make you think about your problem less?", "I wish this virus ends soon.

How are you?", "That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel.", "I also have stopped going out since the pandemic started.", "You are certainly not alone. Has any of this been helpful? Is there more I can do for you?", "To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork.

Someone could have handed them in.", "It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise.", "just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person.", "And i believe you too are good, as you have realised your mistake, so stop worrying or feeling guilty for the act. Be happy:)", "Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you' ve already attempted to discuss it with? Yeah you' re right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could' ve never prepared for.", "I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you.", "I don' t think you' re selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior! Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial.", "Of course, have a great evening!", "oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well.", "I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now.", "Oh I see so right now you' re the main\" parent - er\"? Do you have other family that could take the kids for a wekend so you can have a proper rest?", "Do you have any idea of where you lost them?", "I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed?", "It sounds like you really care about your friend, and want the best for her. She may not realize this but you are doing the right thing.", "ok for sure, It was nice to talk you.", "Tell me about the situation.", "which vaccine did you get?", "I think you' re supposed to end the conversation btw. Have a great day!", "Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.", "Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation?", "Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters.", "I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time?", "It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life.", "I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently.", "Sounds like drunk slander talk. I would let things go for awhile and follow up later.", "Oh.. It' s really sad. But don' t worry. You can explain feelings to her. She may change her mind.", "It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn' t increase along with inflation/ cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially. Of course you' ll need to put your rent and utilities above all else, and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift,", "of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation.", "I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent.", "it happens that you get rejected, but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again:)", "Lovely!", "I hear relaxing music and funny movies can do the trick.", "That' s great! Now you can all go swimming together.

Make sure you' re taking care of yourself first and foremost. That will ultimately provide you success.", "Maybe every day or a few times a week, depending on what you feel is necessary.", "Nice! What kind of music do you like?", "instead try googling the phrase\" how to open up to others\" and there should be a few sites with tips and references.", "That is a good idea. I hope that they have not been deliberately stolen.", "Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes.", "I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money?", "I can through our messages that this is a very tough season for you.", "Is Uber an option for you? I know there' s a lot of rideshare services but they' re not always financially reasonable. But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too!", "i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on.", "It does not hurt to try. Maybe call her and tell her you have some things on your mind and could use some advice from her if it is not to much of a bother..", "Happy Holidays Keri. Keep your head up!", "Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you' ll try them out.

Do you want to talk more detail about that?", "I' d recommend online message boards.", "It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment?", "That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone.", "Hi. How' s it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself.", "Well that is something:) What are you looking forward to?", "That' s terrific to here. I' m happy you' re feeling better. hear* - sorry for the misspelling.:)", "That sounds like a fantastic idea.", "Do you feel it is more stressful online?", "It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder..", "I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not.", "I' m glad I could help and I wish you the best of luck!", "Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered?", "I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources.", "I am proud of the choices you are making and I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control. There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled.", "It could be the cause of her behaviour.", "When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it' s better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn' t stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.", "I understand your feelings. If it is a true love, she will also understand your feelings.", "PA got hit hard with the virus.", "Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example.", "I tried really hard not to let her get to me. Which was really hard but doable.", "I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you' d wish they wear a mask?", "Well, I wish you all the very best for the future. I know that things seem terrible right now but please believe me they will get better.", "Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least?", "That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why?", "So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol?", "Keep venting, if it makes you feel better. I know I do when I can talk to someone I don' t know. Is it nice where you are today, so that you can look at something bigger than the indoors?? That often helps me feel better.", "What is it that is making you feel this way?", "It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums?", "I understand, school was tough for me too.

How are you today?", "yes.", "It sounds like you are doing what you can. It is very nice of you to have been this patient.", "That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that?", "How long have you been in this long - distance relationship?", "I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed.", "Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma. Are you currently working?", "Sometimes when i have to much free time on my hands i start to feel the same but when i find away to fill the time i no longer feel useless. No problem, I hope you feel better soon!", "I am sorry. What is going on?", "That happens but keep looking. It' s a numbers game, so you have to just apply to a ton them once your resume is ready.", "You too. Have a great weekend!!", "At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now:)", "That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself.

Goodnight!", "Try Uber and that is good choice as you are not doing anything.", "It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns.", "College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare.", "Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified.", "did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to.", "Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days.

Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?.", "Luckily, there are many platforms online that allow you to work from home. I know of several that allow you to do side\" gigs\". Perhaps you can search and find a few of these. I, myself have had success doing these.", "It' s ok dear. did you asked him why he did that?", "Ah you did not mention that! Maybe for the sake of your child it might be worth going to counselling again then.", "I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay?", "I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue?", "Started back in to my routine. Work. Church. things like that..", "I think that' s a good call! Do you think you can find a deal somewhere on it?", "It was quite pleasant. And the pay was decent. Plus, I got to read and research a lot. I ended up meeting my wife at the library as well. I felt good taking the job.:)", "Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern.", "Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.", "i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave?", "You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth. Find common ground, an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you.", "That' s a great idea!", "It may sound cheesy to you,, but making a gift for someone is still one of the best ways to tell someone how much you really care.

That may help to break the cycle of feeling low?", "From what I' ve seen, you' re not alone in that feeling. It' s a natural fear for just about anyone approaching something new. But there really aren' t any rules, your life and your decisions decide your success. I' m glad you' re feeling relieved. Your feelings are relevant and completely natural. Just make sure to take care of yourself first and foremost, that' s the most important thing.", "Ok! then we can just wait for the 15 minute mark. Do you know when that will be?", "I' m confident that you can handle this and have every faith that you will reach a resolution.", "yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side.", "It defiitely helps me fall asleep. It' s a natural sleep aid.
