Have you thought about going out and doing that with your friends now?", "Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back!", "Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that?", "It sounds like you' re sticking close to your friend, although it doesn' t feel like its helping. It' s my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn' t always an option.

Do you feel a bit better about things now?", "Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere.

They usually are not trying to hurt us though.", "I would be subtle about that tactic.. If you haven' t met any of his school mates. I wouldn' t pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates?", "It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently?", "I am Tom.

How may I support you?", "The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself.

Can I help you with anything else?", "How long have you not been feeling not so well?", "well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?", "i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you!", "I' m very sorry to hear that.

What do you do.", "Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self.", "it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now.

Plus you have a whole night to study!", "Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on.", "I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly.", "You' re welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful.", "I also talked to a few friends who are married and had experienced infidelity. They chose to forgive each other. I learned a lot from them. It helped me to make up my own mind as to how I needed to move forward. I didn\u2019t want to use a therapist since I do better with discussing ideas with multiple people. But ultimately you may experience a lot of ups and downs. That is also normal. It is your mind and heart processing everything. Please do not get discouraged.", "I read different postings and have over 30 followers.", "things are weird for everyone right now. emotions are running high, covid is running rampant, it' s a mess and understandable that we are all stressed.", "What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?.", "Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe.", "That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help.

The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over.

I like it. It' s good to have something to focus on. When is your goal to finish the book?", "anything else you want to talk about?", "That is extremely understandable.

I' m sorry you' re going through that.", "You are right he still got a whole life ahead of him.", "Exactly, sometimes we need new window to see things by different ankle. So can I ask you what you want me to do or what is really need you right now?", "just hit the quit button and fill out the survey:) Don' t press return tho!.", "I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help.", "How are you?", "oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too.", "That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something!", "Why did you stop playing insturments?", "mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself.", "What did you do for fun before you met her?", "I see. How long have your two friends been arguing?", "Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using?", "Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help.", "You are doing everything you can. Some things are just beyond our control. And we are all struggling, so please know you are not alone in your feelings.", "I' m sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated.", "You are very welcome!", "It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right?", "anything else?", "Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day?", "It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don' t know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship.", "I am glad it does: D! Anything else I can help you with today?", "You said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on Christmas? Today, you mean?", "Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation?", "There are companies hiring.", "I am so proud of you for giving this a try. I would like to suggest OCB relaxing music, which will help you relax.", "I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance?", "No you did not! Please don' t think like that.", "My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don' t convey the meaning 100 percent.", "I hope you do as well!", "all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen.", "To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best.", "I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open?", "i hope i helped you today.", "You are very welcome!", "You must have had good reason' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid.", "How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for?", "Of course! Do you feel like you have people that you could reach out to if you start getting lonely?", "Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:)", "I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn' t think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking.", "do you live near a library?", "Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately?", "Which do you and your man like to communicate?", "You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind.", "I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing.", "You too, have a wonderful day and know you are in my thoughts.", "What sorts of things?", "Your welcome and I love that you are so dedicated to your development.", "Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me.", "Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking?", "Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself.", "I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments?", "Can you talk to your boss possibly and let him know you could do other job to help your boss so that you won' t get laid off?", "Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though.", "and make sure you are not hard on yourself. you' re getting by. you' re hanging in there. you are doing well under the circumstances.", "You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding?", "Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies?", "they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great.", "You both can go for a date or do the things what your partner like. Drinking is luring so stay away from that and you can do it.", "One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid?", "I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too!", "Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.", "have you put in job applications everywhere.", "yes you can do it. just try.", "I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities.", "I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable.", "Exactly! You' ve got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you.", "Family comes first. I would do anything to save my marriage as you are doing. I am proud of you. I am pretty sure you both love each other more than anything.", "Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened?", "Hello, what can I help you with today?", "Well, I love fictions and mystery. Right now I just finished\" The Davinci Code\".", "so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.", "Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews?", "Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing!", "if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart.", "do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient.", "That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression?", "That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand.", "Same here, wish I could' ve been more helpful but we' re in similar situations and nothing else came to my mind. Hang in there, you' re doing great under the circumstances!", "Is she able to support herself financially?", "I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up?", "you dont have to meet a lot of people, but atleast one or two of your friends with all the safety measures? who could really help you, and also one of the best solution can be group studies as well. My pleasure dear friend.", "I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having?", "This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them.", "That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident?", "You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP?", "I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship!", "I understand that! it is very reasonable to want to be around family and friends during the holidays.", "I Know that in the beginning it' s so difficult to do anything, you just want to sleep and do nothing, but with time you' ll feel much better and try start over.", "I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance..", "I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?", "They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later.", "How long are you doing the online school?", "Having no support is so hard:( Especially during these times!", "its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps. is there anytihng else you want to talk about?", "Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective.", "I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup?", "your welcome have a good evening to.", "Doing fine, thank you..", "Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU.", "You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee.", "How are you tonight?.", "If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after.", "okay, can you press quit first as I am not able to do that from my end:). We can' t end the HIT till you press quit and take the survey:)", "Courage is not the absence of the fear, you should fight to find your place.", "Sounds great. I' m glad you didn' t give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better.", "I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being?", "oh that' s nice. youre welcome!", "You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there.", "Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week.", "I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you.", "I can understand that. I am sorry. Was it different when your children were younger? What has changed?", "Anything particular got you down? Hello.", "Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex.", "Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.", "So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single..", "That is understandable. Was it because of the virus.", "You' re welcome!", "oh sorry for misunderstanding you.", "Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now.", "As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it.", "I know what I am after, just have to be persistent. That is a good choice of study.", "Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people.", "Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot!", "Hello! How are you doing?", "Ha, well after two years, feelings had to have changed. Even a little. Does he live nearby?", "that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind.", "I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:(", "That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend?", "Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.", "Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them?", "I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how?", "I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings.", "It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?", "Im hope that i have been able to help at least a little bit.", "Hi, how are you feeling today?", "I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry!", "you can call the store and see if they have anything written by your favorite author.", "I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet.", "Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation.", "If you need anything later, just text me.", "Take care!", "Hey, how are you today?", "I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this.", "Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.", "Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?", "i face this situation long time ago i try my best and then i come out easily because i try my best.", "I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money.", "It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct?", "exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year?", "It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything?", "Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation.", "I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....", "It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right?", "So you have lost some books? Were they important to you?", "So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.", "Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.", "When did this fear start?", "That is why I am here. Is there anything else you would like to chat about?", "Can you tell me more about the fight?", "tell about you? just i chating. what your good name?", "Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends?", "Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression?", "Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.", "It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end.", "Work part - time and go to school part - time.", "In what way does it do that?", "I' m doing good today. What brings you on here?", "I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here!", "Medium only cost 5 a month and you can make money writing about what you have experienced.", "You' re welcome. I wish you the best and many blessings.", "Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but Im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place.", "I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?", "I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic.", "I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest.", "Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?.", "Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods?", "of course! I hope the rest of your year goes well.", "I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you' ll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet. You don' t want to be with a cheater. you should want to be with someone who respects you and treats you well.", "Just stick to the plan. Spend more time together. Cook dinner for her. Make a strong bond and my best wishes are there for you.", "Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.", "get yourself fixed up and cute, and find a hot new guy. your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy. its quite theraputic: D", "I would suggest starting with one of those options.. do you have a resume?", "Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped!", "I can understand.", "I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective.", "Those are completely valid feelings to have at this time. Have you considered getting a small reminder of your cat perhaps a small shrine or tribute to him/ her? Her I apologize for the confusion.", "Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run.", "Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting?", "Just have the confidence within yourselves and believe in YOU, that is the most important thing. Stop worrying, and think about what can make it better.", "Don' t get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.", "Any improvement is still improvement!", "I use Medium and now I also have another account with them called Patreon.", "I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before.", "I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships.", "Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this.", "yes i can understand that.", "oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together?", "Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you.", "It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are?", "Thank you:)", "Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn' t make you selfish at all.", "What types of things was she texting him about?", "Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown.", "Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together?", "Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?", "How bad were you injured.", "Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.", "What age are You?", "Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask)", "have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.", "I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version.", "i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties.", "Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life?", "Thanks for sharing!", "Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/", "i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors?", "There is actually 4 or 5 different marketing brands with Medium. What is your main thing to write about besides movies.", "Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh.", "I thank you for opening up!", "I' ve worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co - workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn' t be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth.", "you know any other self work?", "Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do?", "Have you tried the classified ads? Or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area?", "i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference.", "I feel the same way. I hope you can get things on better terms.", "I understand that completely, I can relate a lot.", "You can end the chat safely now.", "What are you doing? i am john from, new york.", "Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on. That' s good that they don' t push you too much. Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions. I' m sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help... sober fun! Also if you find that you' re struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support. Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking. Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others.", "HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays! If you spend a few hours a day. i' m sure that you' ll find one in no time!!", "Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back.", "Hello, how can i help you today?", "I think if you make some time for yourself and talk to your friends you' ll feel a bit better even though it sucks. I hear you, I' ve had to start over again lots of times. but the right guy is out there. Just imagine how bad it would have been if you found out after you moved in with him. You dodged a bullet! are you still there? Hello?", "So everyone' s plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit' s going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable..", "I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.", "Do you have a husband or bf?", "It sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way.", "That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks?", "one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps? oh thankyou.... had my shot yesterday.... now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire( May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go.", "Kinda Ok, but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy.", "you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID?", "What brings you here today?", "At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic.

How are you?", "It sounds like that could make a big difference in changing things for you. You just need a better work/ life balance to straighten things out. I had a similar experience in the past, and talking with my manager about time off reinvigorated me.", "I' m sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.", "I do know how a programming job can take away from some social aspects of your life, maybe try and go to a bar, or somewhere social to get out some. No problem, I hope I have helped you some. Happy Holidays!", "Do you want to talk about it?", "Thank you.. you know you are not alone in such journey...", "I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well. But I am hoping they get it right, and not just rush to get something out there that may or may not work.", "Ok, so from what I understand is that this is the first time you' ve felt this and you are lost because you don' t know how to act and react to this.", "Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important.", "I started going to college in 94 and still going.", "That could be a great distraction. You could start practicing soccer again. You definitely have more time for it now. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up? Sometimes talking with a close friend or family member can help a lot too.", "Im doing great thanks. Anything on your mind today?", "Do you think you both might be open to talking to a marriage counselor?", "Is the patient a ward of the state.", "It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life.", "That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you?", "That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now.", "It would be good to do that. Maybe try to have a conversation and tell her you support her no matter what she' s going through.", "Well, can you tell me about it anyway? I am happy to listen.

You can find something too.", "That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this.", "I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware.", "Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off?", "Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights.

Take what we are doing right now for instance.", "hope you feel better.", "Calm down friend.", "How do you know that your partner is cheating on you? Did he tell you that he is?", "That' s a fare worry but you can' t be discourged. YOu need to think positively.

Maybe, they would offer some new suggestions.", "What is on your mind?", "I think it would definitely help to talk to her about it, it is never good to let situations like this build up without being talked about..", "Sounds like you' re definitely well off out of that one!!", "I agree, it is hard to spend time with people at the moment. We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted.

Can you tell me more?", "Yes just a moment.", "Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens?

You seem like a good persn.", "If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX( which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing. I am sure that other places are looking for audio editing. I think Fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work.

Why does your son not like your boyfriend?", "What a great idea about learning new skills. It would be a great investment of your time, as well as improve your human capital. Win - win.

I am happy I could help you during such a difficult time. How long have you been at the job?", "Why did he leave you?", "Sure, my pleasure!", "Hmm= that is frustrating.

You really are better off without him.", "no problem. stay safe.", "Sometimes it' s best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding.", "like working out? it will give you a lot of benefits especially with your health. you can do it!", "I understand being angry about that. Going to school supposedly is/ was a way to take control of one' s life, it' s no longer the guarantee is once was.. I sometimes feel a similar way about my own classes. I am also in my thirties.. But I personally enjoy learning, and would always regret it if I never finished my degree. We all have our cultural norms that we conform to, whether consciously or unconsciously.

Maybe having a professional in your career path review your resume would be helpful.", "Goodbye.", "Oh. I can feel it. I have someone who' s sick as well. Do you have any one friend with whom you can share your feelings, your depression. I understand you' re having issues with depression, right?

And, at the other end of this, we will be able to give the biggest hugs ever!", "I would start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her.

Are you working or on layoff.", "Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I' ve been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn' t because we grow out of them, it' s quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.", "you too.", "I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner.

I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect?", "also, i think it depends on where you are in the world. covid hit my area really hard around april/ may, but things are completely back to normal now. people hardly wear masks, stores are open, it just takes time.", "ok, don' t worry friend,", "LOL if only everyone had that thought process.

What caused the break up? Was it mutual? Or was it one sided?", "Well I am happy to listen to any problems that you have.", "Remember to always keep a positive mindset.

Where do you live.", "how are you? what' s new with you?", "Where are you that you are able to be evicted?

That at least can help you financially until you get a new job.", "I think the best way is to move on.", "Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work.", "Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep... the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more?", "I personally understand how difficult this can be. But if this works out. You can have a good family relationship and maintain a good relationship with your girlfriend. Best of luck!", "Yes! Making lists can be a great idea and help organize some thoughts and ideas you have in your head.", "But what about the family?", "Anytime! It was nice meeting you. Bye - now.", "It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you?

Have a great day!", "Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.", "Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation?", "Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters.", "I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time?", "It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life.", "I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently.", "Sounds like drunk slander talk. I would let things go for awhile and follow up later.", "Oh.. It' s really sad. But don' t worry. You can explain feelings to her. She may change her mind.", "It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn' t increase along with inflation/ cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially.

Keep your head up!", "Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you' ll try them out.

We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it' s better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married.

If it is a true love, she will also understand your feelings.", "PA got hit hard with the virus.", "Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example.", "I tried really hard not to let her get to me. Which was really hard but doable.", "I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy.

Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol?", "Keep venting, if it makes you feel better. I know I do when I can talk to someone I don' t know. Is it nice where you are today, so that you can look at something bigger than the indoors??
