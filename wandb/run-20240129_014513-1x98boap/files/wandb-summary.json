Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed?", "You are welcome. Can I help you with anything else?", "How long have you not been feeling not so well?", "well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?", "i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you!", "I' m very sorry to hear that.

What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin?", "Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long?", "even so you may be able to refer this situation for review to a financial regulator.", "That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do.", "Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self.", "it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.", "oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it?

Plus you have a whole night to study!", "Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on.", "I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly.", "You' re welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful.", "I also talked to a few friends who are married and had experienced infidelity. They chose to forgive each other. I learned a lot from them. It helped me to make up my own mind as to how I needed to move forward. I didn't want to use a therapist since I do better with discussing ideas with multiple people.

I' m a flea to the universe.", "That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help.

Maybe you can write that on your list - - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that.

The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc.", "What did she say when you broke up?", "Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/ weeks.

On that note, I hope I have been able to give you some reassurance and thanks for talking!", "Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see.

Can you press quit first as alas I can' t do it from my end till you have.", "My I suggestion you pick your closest friend, and talk to her/ him about your feeling, but not about your boyfriend, about how you feel your friends have been treating you.

Merry Christmas!", "Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed.", "if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment.

What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed??", "What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that.

Was it an accident, illness or natural old age?", "With COVID - 19, it may limit your options, but you could decide which activities you would collectively enjoy the most, and try to do them as often as possible together.", "You can try as a school driver. As school now opened You will get it.", "You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way.", "Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot.", "I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive.", "Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose.

I hope you find resolution and find a way to save your friendship!", "That must feel really isolating.

I have had break ups too. They are never easy.", "Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things?", "that seems excessive.

Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!.", "That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure.

Do you have any other jobs?", "of course you can try different things.", "Meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead. And the wild? that' s whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature:)", "Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you' re keeping safe! I' m not sure of all the details on your job so I' m having a hard time making firm suggestions.

Yeah, that' s a great idea!", "It was nice speaking with you today.", "Well, what about you finding a counselor for yourself who could help you with your own self - care?

Would you like to tell me more details?", "Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn' t have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it' s 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do.

You might have written a best seller and not know it.", "... then you have to wonder, what are fleas thinking?!.", "I completely understand.

Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.", "For sure, what else we need to talk about?", "That is reasonable. And it sounds like you are doing all you can. Could you teach from home online and keep yourself safe? Or perhaps provide your son financial support?", "Please do!

I struggled financially, but took any job I could.....", "Have you talked to him recently?", "Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.", "I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be.

Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol.

And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you!

If he says yes, or is excited, that is a good sign that he wants to be with you.... even after work.", "Thank you. I hope you' re feeling a bit better. Is there anything else you want to talk about?", "So you are saying that you can' t live regularly and people don' t understand that your mind isn' t working in your favor. Is that right? Can you tell me what you mean by your mind being your enemy?", "Tell me more. What has you feeling sad?", "I suggest you keep close touch with the support group and the therapist.. I see you are already in the right path..", "i am nervous at times too and i usually try to take a break and do something i find comfort in when i feel like that. i can' t imagine how siffucult must be for you to feel like this often. i' m sure you will be able to find a way to relief your anxiety.", "Not a problem! I am glad I was able to talk to you tonight!", "Have you talked with your friends on how you feel? When was the last time you all connected?", "Ouch! Your friend got arrested for drugs last week?", "You bet, I hope you feel so much better and can take that with you tomorrow - - that you had a good day on the day after Christmas!!!!", "it' s okay. we should learn from things like this.", "Hello, how are you feeling today?.", "I understand you pain and frustration. I have very close friend who has ADHD and trying to cope with it.", "I am glad this was helpful for you and hope you will seek further advice if you feel the need to discuss with someone unbiased.", "Yes, I see that you seemed to be more relieved finding out these options. Would you say these suggestions have been helpful?", "that must have been really terrible, i hope you all are coping with that. how did that make you feel?", "Cheating on you?", "That' s a great idea, everyone loves feeding birds! Glad we were able to chat.", "Oh okay I didn' t know that thanks!", "They should have a talk because communication is key and that will solve a lot.", "I have had the same problems in the past with some friends not being there for me when I need it, so I completely understand where you' re coming from..", "Is that what you are going to school for?", "There are incense burning kits that can help to relieve stress and trauma. Yes, the Calm app is one.", "I also felt that way around finals and with friends, I think it' s important to recognize this is one semester and that it' s equally as important to take care of yourself as it is to pass those finals.", "Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to?", "He should not be treating you that way when you' ve known one another so long!", "my second monitor is not portable. I don' t know if that would work for me because I work better in one designated spot. So I have 3 monitors on my desk( 2 separate monitors and my laptop screen). however something like That would definitely be something I' d look into if I was in school or taking classes.", "that' s an option but I hope it doesn' t go that far again. Have you tried maybe a mediation with the ex friend and your current friend?", "Right i can understand how you are feeling. We all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails. I have been in a situation like that.", "just wait till fifteen mins is up;). If we quit before then we get less. So, um, tell me about your ex?", "Yea that can be difficult. Have you started looking for something else?", "very true.. just keep on keeping on!:)", "Oh, that is anxiety - provoking.... How long have you b een searching?", "well, just think of some happy memories and try to spend time with people who value you the most.", "Sometimes we really just have to let things go. I know it' s hard but it will probably good for your mental health. I hope that I have been able to help you today! It' s a difficult situation for sure.", "From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing.", "lot of people lose the job in this corona time. just explain you situation.", "Just keep your eyes on the prize because this means that HE has something bigger in store for you!", "that' s really bad. even I was also in the same situation.", "how long has this been going on?", "Then you already have a plan. I like it. It' s good to have something to focus on. When is your goal to finish the book?", "anything else you want to talk about?", "That is extremely understandable. The pandemic is an event no one was prepared for, and it has cause unforseen upheavals.. That is a tough situation, being isolated physically from those that you love. I' m sorry you' re going through that.", "You are right he still got a whole life ahead of him.", "Exactly, sometimes we need new window to see things by different ankle. So can I ask you what you want me to do or what is really need you right now?", "just hit the quit button and fill out the survey:) Don' t press return tho!.", "I did not see that, I am sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It might help.", "How are you?", "oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn' t it? I sometimes think it' s meaningless too.", "That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something!", "Why did you stop playing insturments?", "mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself.", "What did you do for fun before you met her?", "I see. How long have your two friends been arguing?", "Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight. What kind of methods have you been using?", "Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help.", "You are doing everything you can. Some things are just beyond our control. And we are all struggling, so please know you are not alone in your feelings.", "I' m sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated.", "You are very welcome!", "It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right?", "anything else?", "Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day?", "It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don' t know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship.", "I am glad it does: D! Anything else I can help you with today?", "You said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on Christmas? Today, you mean?", "Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation?", "There are companies hiring.", "I am so proud of you for giving this a try. I would like to suggest OCB relaxing music, which will help you relax.", "I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance?", "No you did not! Please don' t think like that.", "My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don' t convey the meaning 100 percent.", "I hope you do as well!", "all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen.", "To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best.", "I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open?", "i hope i helped you today.", "You are very welcome!", "You must have had good reason' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid.", "How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for?", "Of course! Do you feel like you have people that you could reach out to if you start getting lonely?", "Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:)", "I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn' t think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking.", "do you live near a library?", "Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately?", "Which do you and your man like to communicate?", "You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind.", "I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing.", "You too, have a wonderful day and know you are in my thoughts.", "What sorts of things?", "Your welcome and I love that you are so dedicated to your development.", "Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me.", "Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking?", "Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself.", "I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments?", "Can you talk to your boss possibly and let him know you could do other job to help your boss so that you won' t get laid off?", "Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though.", "and make sure you are not hard on yourself. you' re getting by. you' re hanging in there. you are doing well under the circumstances.", "You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding?", "Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies?", "they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great.", "You both can go for a date or do the things what your partner like. Drinking is luring so stay away from that and you can do it.", "One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid?", "I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too!", "Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.", "have you put in job applications everywhere.", "yes you can do it. just try.", "I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities.", "I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable.", "Exactly! You' ve got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you.", "Family comes first. I would do anything to save my marriage as you are doing. I am proud of you. I am pretty sure you both love each other more than anything.", "Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened?", "Hello, what can I help you with today?", "Well, I love fictions and mystery. Right now I just finished\" The Davinci Code\".", "so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.", "Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews?", "Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing!", "if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart.", "do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient.", "That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression?", "That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand.", "Same here, wish I could' ve been more helpful but we' re in similar situations and nothing else came to my mind. Hang in there, you' re doing great under the circumstances!", "Is she able to support herself financially?", "I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up?", "you dont have to meet a lot of people, but atleast one or two of your friends with all the safety measures? who could really help you, and also one of the best solution can be group studies as well. My pleasure dear friend.", "I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having?", "This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them.", "That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident?", "You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP?", "I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship!", "I understand that! it is very reasonable to want to be around family and friends during the holidays.", "I Know that in the beginning it' s so difficult to do anything, you just want to sleep and do nothing, but with time you' ll feel much better and try start over.", "I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance..", "I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?", "They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later.", "How long are you doing the online school?", "Having no support is so hard:( Especially during these times!", "its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps. is there anytihng else you want to talk about?", "Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective.", "I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup?", "your welcome have a good evening to.", "Doing fine, thank you..", "Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU.", "You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee.", "How are you tonight?.", "If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after.", "okay, can you press quit first as I am not able to do that from my end:). We can' t end the HIT till you press quit and take the survey:)", "Courage is not the absence of the fear, you should fight to find your place.", "Sounds great. I' m glad you didn' t give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better.", "I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being?", "oh that' s nice. youre welcome!", "You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there.", "Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week.", "I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you.", "I can understand that. I am sorry. Was it different when your children were younger? What has changed?", "Anything particular got you down? Hello.", "Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex.", "Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.", "So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single..", "That is understandable. Was it because of the virus.", "You' re welcome!", "oh sorry for misunderstanding you.", "Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now.", "As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it.", "I know what I am after, just have to be persistent. That is a good choice of study.", "Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people.", "Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot!", "Hello! How are you doing?", "Ha, well after two years, feelings had to have changed. Even a little. Does he live nearby?", "that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind.", "I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:(", "That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend?", "Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.", "Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them?", "I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how?", "I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings.", "It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?", "Im hope that i have been able to help at least a little bit.", "Hi, how are you feeling today?", "I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry!", "you can call the store and see if they have anything written by your favorite author.", "I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet.", "Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation.", "If you need anything later, just text me.", "Take care!", "Hey, how are you today?", "I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this.", "Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.", "Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?", "i face this situation long time ago i try my best and then i come out easily because i try my best.", "I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money.", "It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct?", "exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year?", "It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything?", "Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation.", "I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....", "It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right?", "So you have lost some books? Were they important to you?", "So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.", "Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.", "When did this fear start?", "That is why I am here. Is there anything else you would like to chat about?", "Can you tell me more about the fight?", "tell about you? just i chating. what your good name?", "Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends?", "Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression?", "Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.", "It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end.", "Work part - time and go to school part - time.", "In what way does it do that?", "I' m doing good today. What brings you on here?", "I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here!", "Medium only cost 5 a month and you can make money writing about what you have experienced.", "You' re welcome. I wish you the best and many blessings.", "Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but Im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place.", "I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?", "I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic.", "I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest.", "Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?.", "Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods?", "of course! I hope the rest of your year goes well.", "I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you' ll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet. You don' t want to be with a cheater. you should want to be with someone who respects you and treats you well.", "Just stick to the plan. Spend more time together. Cook dinner for her. Make a strong bond and my best wishes are there for you.", "Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.", "get yourself fixed up and cute, and find a hot new guy. your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy. its quite theraputic: D", "I would suggest starting with one of those options.. do you have a resume?", "Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped!", "I can understand.", "I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective.", "Those are completely valid feelings to have at this time. Have you considered getting a small reminder of your cat perhaps a small shrine or tribute to him/ her? Her I apologize for the confusion.", "Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run.", "Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting?", "Just have the confidence within yourselves and believe in YOU, that is the most important thing. Stop worrying, and think about what can make it better.", "Don' t get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.", "Any improvement is still improvement!", "I use Medium and now I also have another account with them called Patreon.", "I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before.", "I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships.", "Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this.", "yes i can understand that.", "oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together?", "Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you.", "It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are?", "Thank you:)", "Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn' t make you selfish at all.", "What types of things was she texting him about?", "Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown.", "Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together?", "Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?", "How bad were you injured.", "Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.", "What age are You?", "Oh, boy, do I know that feeling! How are you dealing with it?( if I may ask)", "have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn' t want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn' t mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.", "I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version.", "i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties.", "Do you think those jobs would help you disconnect your childhood trauma and work life?", "Thanks for sharing!", "Ah, can you give me a few more details? I am sure I will be able to help/", "i enjoy historical non fiction very much. do you have any favorite authors?", "There is actually 4 or 5 different marketing brands with Medium. What is your main thing to write about besides movies.", "Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh.", "I thank you for opening up!", "I' ve worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co - workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn' t be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth.", "you know any other self work?", "Friends closeby? Hobbies? What kind of work do you do?", "Have you tried the classified ads? Or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area?", "i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference.", "I feel the same way. I hope you can get things on better terms.", "I understand that completely, I can relate a lot.", "You can end the chat safely now.", "What are you doing? i am john from, new york.", "Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on. That' s good that they don' t push you too much. Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions. I' m sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help... sober fun! Also if you find that you' re struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support. Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking. Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others.", "HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays! If you spend a few hours a day. i' m sure that you' ll find one in no time!!", "Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back.", "Hello, how can i help you today?", "I think if you make some time for yourself and talk to your friends you' ll feel a bit better even though it sucks. I hear you, I' ve had to start over again lots of times. but the right guy is out there. Just imagine how bad it would have been if you found out after you moved in with him. You dodged a bullet! are you still there? Hello?", "So everyone' s plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit' s going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable..", "I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.", "Do you have a husband or bf?", "It sounds like you feel you are not heard and thats why you are pushing yourself hard do you feel that way.", "That' s no good. I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with. Have you thought about teaming up with a friend and going on daily walks?", "one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps? oh thankyou.... had my shot yesterday.... now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire( May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go.", "Kinda Ok, but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy.", "you mean, is your job defined by maximum exposure to people right now due to COVID?", "What brings you here today?", "At some grocery stores, they have made pick - up free due to the pandemic.

It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this.", "I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware.", "Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off?", "Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights.

I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership.

Come back and talk after you finish your next chapter?", "I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren' t acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn' t MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling..", "were you happy with him or were you happy that you were with the popular guy?", "Well, if it' s possible, I would talk to a doctor.

Has she been in contact with you?", "Yes in the US, thanksgiving was just with close family members.", "Why not text her 1st to break the ice. But maybe she is feeling like she is alone also.", "you welcome.. anything else you want to talk about?", "Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, I have had exes do that to me.

We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted. It would be good to have something positive to look forward to.", "I' m glad to speak to you today. It sounds like you are having anxious thoughts. Can you tell me more?", "Yes just a moment.", "Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens? It is hard but you can only really control yourself, so you need to try to emotionally distance yourself from when she is terrible. You seem like a good persn.", "If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX( which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing. I am sure that other places are looking for audio editing. I think Fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work.

I' m sure you' re handling the situation as best as you can.

In the past, what did you do for your depression?", "Is there anything you can do to distract yourself right now?

I meant to say that this would not be a route that involves any medication at all potentially.", "Awhile. it started to feel a little bit better after I kept telling myself it was about him and not about me, then I started feeling a bit better.

We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it' s better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn' t stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.", "I understand your feelings.

I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to.", "Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days.
