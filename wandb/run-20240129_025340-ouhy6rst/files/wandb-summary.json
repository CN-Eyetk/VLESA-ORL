Just a thought.... you say you always look like a mess... is that your personal opinion or has anyone else commented on your hair?", "I understand how frustrating that can be to not be part of the group activities.", "if you are more comfortable texting him then i would suggest doing that but i would not just say nothing about you buying the car you should just let him know.", "i am fine thanks for asking.", "I can understand why your boyfriend be getting upset if your son is disrespectful to you and is aggressive but you know that is your son and you going to be there for him no matter what.", "You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair. Yes, go ahead, the problems will vanish.", "Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well?", "Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make. Connect with friends you may have lost touch with. Your going to be great.", "Oh for my situation it was 100% my fault i was in a bad place during that time. I spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me. Bounced around shelters after i sold my car. Washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems. May i ask what state you are in?", "I hope that she does the right thing and that you can stay friends. Good luck to you.", "That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It' s normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point. Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong, you can always change your major.", "Yes. If you want to.", "Well, it' s worth a try, right!", "I can understand how you might feel anxious. There are lots of uncertainties right now. I am sorry you are going through this. Are you able to find work or help from the government?", "Hello though, how has life been treating you lately?", "They all took his side? Not one took yours?", "Mindfulness and yoga have proven to help overcome feelings of low mood and perhaps you could try with taking a few deep breaths and listening to some calming music before going to bed tonight. Do you think that, you can try something like this?", "How was your career path different? I understand how you are feeling everything will be okay.", "I loved doing that too! Have you thought about going out and doing that with your friends now?", "Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back!", "Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that?", "It sounds like you' re sticking close to your friend, although it doesn' t feel like its helping. It' s my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn' t always an option. The most important thing you can do for her is just to be there for her and allow her to feel however she needs to feel right now.", "Have you googled images for short curly hairstyles?", "How have you been able to get by?", "yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out.", "That is a good strategy, all the news outlets can be very overwhelming.", "If you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him. Just do not force yourself if you are not comfortable doing that.", "i can understand that. the stress is interfering with your thoughts but you are still doing a good job. you are doing the best you can do; that' s the best anyone can do.", "You are very welcome!", "I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you.", "From what I' m understanding, you' re not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you' re heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety - provoking position.", "Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do. I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too.", "yes. it totally depends on how mature the person is. just forgive him and keep in mind for next time whether you should share something with him or not.", "Those sound like really good coping skills.", "Well, I hope that I have been able to offer some useful suggestions. Do you feel a bit better about things now?", "Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward.", "So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety? Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever?", "Sorry to hear that. I feel you because I had an experience about breaking my bones. It was sad story. how you feel right now.", "I like to hear that, I am a proud American myself.", "My husband and I actually have worked with recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don' t want to change.", "What level of alcohol consumption do you have?", "Hello, how are you today?", "No problem! That' s why I am here to help you. Have a wonderful life ahead!", "So as far as I understand that you had issues with your wife due to your drinking. Am I right?", "Have you thought about talking with this friend about these feelings?", "Apparently psychologist is good for people who want to share feelings and emotions.", "wow, I definitely wouldn' t go through with that then. Are you sure he was cheating?", "You are getting out of alcoholism and feeling bad about it emotionally, is that right?", "its only in your mind.", "Have a great day.", "but, it' s left you feeling sad. how are things going otherwise?", "I' m sure you will do just fine, you can do it!", "You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened?", "I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though.", "I would be subtle about that tactic.. If you haven' t met any of his school mates. I wouldn' t pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates?", "It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently?", "I am Tom. How can I help you? How are you in need of assistance?", "thats good what do you have planned for the holidays?", "You can support your family by working at the library and reading up on higher paying jobs while there.", "I sometimes do Meditation or go for a 10 mins walk.", "I can certainly understand that. Are you working or attending classes from home?.", "She may need some space to figure things out. I know it' s going to be tough but I believe you can get past this.", "Yeah, this has really been a hard time for all of us. How has it impacted you personally?", "Hi there! How may I support you?", "The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life.", "frustration and anger are common responses in situations like this, perhaps you can try a softer approach and let him know how you feel, without pressuring him into a response.", "Have you explained to him your reasoning? I also once had to take care of my sick grandmother after work and had a tough time explaining it to my boss. Have you offered to stay later to make up the work?", "We are in similar situation. These days I only go out for grocery shopping.", "Hi Keri. How are you today?", "Is it affecting your work or your home life?", "Is there anything else I should know about how the pandemic is affecting you?", "Ok. I am happy to listen..", "I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today. Have you tried talking to you parents about why she is\" bad news\"?", "You' ve come to a good place to start. Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed?", "You are welcome. Can I help you with anything else?", "How long have you not been feeling not so well?", "well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?", "i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you!", "I' m very sorry to hear that. The fact that it is ongoing must make it even harder. What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin?", "Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long?", "even so you may be able to refer this situation for review to a financial regulator.", "That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do.", "Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self.", "it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.", "oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it?", "What about online classes that enable you to study and work also.", "What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!", "Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on.", "I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly.", "You' re welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful.", "I also talked to a few friends who are married and had experienced infidelity. They chose to forgive each other. I learned a lot from them. It helped me to make up my own mind as to how I needed to move forward. I didn't want to use a therapist since I do better with discussing ideas with multiple people. But ultimately you may experience a lot of ups and downs. That is also normal. It is your mind and heart processing everything. Please do not get discouraged.", "I read different postings and have over 30 followers.", "things are weird for everyone right now. emotions are running high, covid is running rampant, it' s a mess and understandable that we are all stressed.", "What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?.", "Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe.", "That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won' t be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home.", "Thank you for reaching out. It really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal. I hope you succeed.", "So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,.", "It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. Maybe you can write that on your list - - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends. I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years, it isn' t easy, but it' s part of maturing in life.", "I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it' s not the same as face to face.", "welcome dear.", "So what was the problem? Tell me more. I can' t help you if you don' t talk to me darling'", "popularity in my opinion, it' s just an opinion( I hope I make sense) but think about how you' d like to be treated and how you want to feel when you are with someone, because at the end of the day it' s your feelings and your happiness, I wish you the best of luck.", "So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before?", "I just decided.", "how are you?", "thats hard,.. but you can do it.", "yes.... but my recycling pile has gottene out of hand with amazon boxes. oops lol.", "Think positive my dear friend. Shake all your negatives.", "what made you like someone else in the first place?", "Hello, how are you today?", "Be creative! Get silly! most important have fun! this is a hard year but its still a chance to make happy memories. Is there anything else on your mind?", "Great ideas! Is there anything else I can help you with?", "bye...", "Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things?", "That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband.", "That' s pretty tough. You' re like the 3rd person today who have been going through this,", "Hello, how are you doing today?", "Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice.", "They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc.", "What did she say when you broke up?", "Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/ weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well.", "Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online?", "I' ve had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It' s difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment.", "It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right?", "I couldn' t agree more. We will get through this with each others help.", "Just never give up. Two years will go by quickly if you keep attending. Look for grants that will assist you.", "maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it.", "Maybe it can be a good opportunity for her to change her lifestyle and get off the drugs. On that note, I hope I have been able to give you some reassurance and thanks for talking!", "Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns?", "Are they okay with it when you decline?", "So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to?", "I am glad I was able to help!", "Most welcome! Can you press quit first as alas I can' t do it from my end till you have.", "My I suggestion you pick your closest friend, and talk to her/ him about your feeling, but not about your boyfriend, about how you feel your friends have been treating you. Be nice but firm. I bet once they hear your pain, they will be very supportive.", "May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family.", "No problem. Merry Christmas!", "Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed.", "if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help.", "do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better?", "You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me.", "I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity. Anything that will give me a lift, so that my own depression won' t get so bad that I can' t remember what it felt like to be a bit happy.", "yeah I could understand your feelings right now.", "Im sorry to hear that. What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed??", "What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest.", "That' s a great idea! Just remember to be kind to yourself and take breaks when you need to! Aw, I' m glad!", "I know how you are feeling about that.", "stay strong and stay safe.", "I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.", "I enjoyed chatting with you. Take care.", "I see that, have you tried to talk to your friends about this issue? Or even try a therapist? Maybe you and your Fiance can figure out more times to talk with facetime or zoom. Do a virtual date night.", "I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you!", "Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job?", "You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys?", "Why cant you seek help from a friend of yours who studies well? And who is ready to spend time and help you.", "Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work. I only work with a few people, so that helps.", "Oh.... That' s so tough... it being the first year!!!! Sometimes, I cry( I cry with my cat), and just to say the feelings out loud makes me feel a bit better.", "It is sometimes hard for people to believe someone they care about could do something bad.", "I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean.", "Hope you feel relaxed just chatting with me for a change.", "ok, that is a bit of relief. have u check for job vacancy in your state.", "Why did he break up with you?", "nobody likes to see that one' s friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back.", "Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age?", "With COVID - 19, it may limit your options, but you could decide which activities you would collectively enjoy the most, and try to do them as often as possible together.", "You can try as a school driver. As school now opened You will get it.", "You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way.", "Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot.", "I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive.", "Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key. I hope discussing your work situation today has made you feel a bit better!", "To be honest, here what I feel about you.. you have a lots of good qualities, you are a wonderful person. However, you shortchange yourself. If you can, please start building some self confidence.. Be proud of yourself.. Someone having a good hubby does not mean that she is happier than you.", "you are welcome. Good luck! I hope you find resolution and find a way to save your friendship!", "That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you' re doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another.", "Have you gave any thought to babysitting or are there any crafts you are good at making that maybe you could try to sell?", "I completely understand. I have had break ups too. They are never easy.", "Have you tried picking up odd jobs maybe cleaning for someone or helping them move or organize there things?", "that seems excessive. I had a similar situation happened myself once and what I did was transfer the balance of one of my cards onto another.", "That sounds like a definite winner:) I see a Turner prize beckoning in your future.", "Hello, how are you?", "And what do you mean by microcheating?", "Oh good to know. Yeah, I don' t know if virtual concerts can ever really compare to live ones.", "Sure, that' s understandable. There are opportunities throughout the day to get a little more vitamin D, you just have to make sure to give yourself time to enjoy them..", "as long as you believe in yourself to be honest, don' t worry about what other people think. Your boss will come to understand you are a honest worker. It is also amazing that you have come such a long way without having other problems. that is great!.", "That will give yourself too much emotion burden for sure. Have you visited a physician for suggestion of your pain relief? Maybe yoga will be a more gentle way to replace dancing. What do you think?", "There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it' s worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn' t available. Sometimes its good to have options.", "I hope your move goes smoothly.... try to make sure you carve out time for YOU... bye!", "You mentioned your friends feel the same way you do... Have you guys thought about making trying to do a zoom party?", "That' s great. I think the first step is always the hardest but you come across as someone that is willing to seek help and I believe that if you face into this you can overcome it witht he right support.", "We are on the same boat. Do you have any other jobs?", "of course you can try different things.", "Meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead. And the wild? that' s whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature:)", "Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you' re keeping safe! I' m not sure of all the details on your job so I' m having a hard time making firm suggestions. How would you feel about that?", "Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you.", "And yet here we are: P. Therapy can be surprisingly beneficial, I have found.. I do realise that it can be hard to open up to how we are feeling though. I know that I was.", "If you want a better communication, I believe in person will be best.", "I have seen things only get worse in a situation like yours. I think h needs to accept that he needs to grow up. How old are the both of you? Any other counseling that I can give?", "I' m sorry to hear you lost your job and have worries about paying the bills.", "What is one little area that maybe seems easier to start with? Yeah, that' s a great idea!", "It was nice speaking with you today.", "Well, what about you finding a counselor for yourself who could help you with your own self - care? Perhaps it could be a start and then he/ she could help you end your marriage if you still want to. It took me awhile to learn my own value and how important self - care is.", "That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?.", "Can you share?", "Ok, that is good. I once worked at a library.", "Dont think that. You are worthy, you just need to apply yourself in the right direction:)", "Do you feel you are complaining?", "I' m sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don' t have any job for a long time now.", "Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this.. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well..", "I am a little confused. Are you looking for employment or not?", "Do some chores or something that helps her out and just let her know you want to have a serious talk some time.", "It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration.", "Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can' t it? What are you supposed to produce?", "I don' t know but some girls were playing with a guys intense feelings.", "It says a lot about your character that you feel badly about this, that you can see and recognize you acted in a way you don' t agree with. That' s something to build on. That desire to\" get even\" is definitely understandable.", "yes. let it go and don' t confuse it again. trust me. you became stronger by this.", "It sounds like that is more of his problem then. You deserve someone that' s better than leaving someone because of their age.", "North West but close:)", "After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn' t until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it.", "When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday(+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time.", "How long have you been in a relationship with your man?", "What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job.", "you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality.", "You are welcome, best wishes.", "It sounds like you must really care about your friends and family, and this awful pandemic is prevent your from seeing them.", "This is a very challenging time for you especially when there is lack of support. I do feel your pain, And I would like to share some advise and suggestions which may alleviate some of the hurt and pain you are going through. Would you e open to hear them out?", "I would calmly ask her. She will most likely deny it. But, some ofher friends may already know about this. If she says she did, ask her if there was something you did wrongthat made her do it. Sometimes its not even the Cheatee. Sometimes they just do it for no good reason.", "I think you have not put any real effort into completing this HIT.", "Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways.", "They were but I didn' t pay much attention:) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that' s all.", "Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality we don' t know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect.", "have a good day!", "What happened?", "That' s good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you' ve known this person for a long time before you got together?", "However, we shouldn' t let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard.", "it sounds to me like you liked the title more than the feeling of being with him, reflecting on your time together, would you do that again?", "it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you.", "perhaps you can spend some time doing pleasant things. it is true that time seems to go fast when we' re having fun.", "How close in the library?", "It sounds like you are doing your best to be nice but it isn' t getting through.", "I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it..", "Oh wow, it sounds like shes not a very good frined.", "It wouldn' t hurt to try and reach out. If she isn' t available, there are other services.", "Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers.", "don' t think, you are good person.", "definitely, don' t worry.. oh, ok.", "I can imagine that you are feeling lonely. Did you have any mutual friends with your best friend that you can reach out to? I am sure they are feeling the same way and it could help both of you to talk to each other and share stories.", "So here is some information that I have in my files to help others during this time. There is self - help. org that is labeled as being a self help during these times. There is also websites that i used like offerup and PoshMark where I was able to start selling some of my belongings to constantly bring in funds.

I am just taking in the fresh air in the backyard.", "It' s really hard for people in our situation right now because there' s only so many virtual things to attend but maybe I just thought of a virtual cocktail hour, and you could go on Facebook or even meetup. com or a free dating site to connect with other people in our situation who live near you. The book club is a great idea.", "You seem like you know what you are doing, I think you will do just fine.", "Maybe schedule in a call with her for the future?

Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?", "I see what you mean about pathetic lol. But rather than see yourself as pathetic in a negative, use that defiance to push yourself back out into the world.

Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol.

You shouldn' t blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you!

I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren' t making a lot that is still something!", "Why did you stop playing insturments?", "mine are in another state so i don' t have to worry about my behavior. you are right though, anyone can get it... i should probably be more careful myself.", "What did you do for fun before you met her?", "I see. How long have your two friends been arguing?", "Wow it sounds like you have really been trying hard to lose weight.

I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated.", "You are very welcome!", "It sounds like you' re finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it' s the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having. Does that sound right?", "anything else?", "Yeah, I' ve definitely felt that way... especially during COVID and having to adjust to working from home. What are some of the things in your routine during the day?", "It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated. The bonds of friendship are worth the confrontation. If they don' t know what is bothering you, it will be harder to mend the relationship.", "I am glad it does: D! Anything else I can help you with today?", "You said that he has announced to you he has ended the relationship on Christmas? Today, you mean?", "Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation?", "There are companies hiring.", "I am so proud of you for giving this a try. I would like to suggest OCB relaxing music, which will help you relax.", "I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance?", "No you did not! Please don' t think like that.", "My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don' t convey the meaning 100 percent.", "I hope you do as well!", "all you can honestly really do right now is to try to improve your resume and see if that helps any and just keep searching for jobs and putting in applications and i know you will get a call from a job soon. yes it has been a bad year for anything to happen.", "To never speak to your fiance? If you want to continue your relationship and you do not feel you can continue a platonic relationship with this other person then that might be best.", "I realise that this must be difficult but isn' t it best to get things out into the open?", "i hope i helped you today.", "You are very welcome!", "You must have had good reason' s to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it. Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards. You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did. Im sure the reasons are still valid.", "How much would it hurt you to end the friendship? Do you think you could make other friends and survive it or is it worth fighting for?", "Of course! Do you feel like you have people that you could reach out to if you start getting lonely?", "Ah yes, it is not cheap. I am not sure how much to suggest as it' s not legal in my country:)", "I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn' t think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking.", "do you live near a library?", "Oh no. I' m sorry to hear that. What do you think would be the cause of you feeling down lately?", "Which do you and your man like to communicate?", "You can still travel domestically or just around your city. I like taking a walk in the park or wandering downtown to clear my mind.", "I think your feelings are normal, but if I were you, I might try to remember that the decisions of others aren' t always a reflection of us or how we' re performing.", "You too, have a wonderful day and know you are in my thoughts.", "What sorts of things?", "Your welcome and I love that you are so dedicated to your development.", "Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me.", "Oh I understand. Have you thought about other ways to get back home besides walking?", "Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong. You shouldn' t blame yourself.", "I see. It is a financially difficult time for us all. I am wondering if your friend might be upset and embarrassed that they can not pay you back immediately? Have you asked her if she could even afford some sort of small payments?", "Can you talk to your boss possibly and let him know you could do other job to help your boss so that you won' t get laid off?", "Ah, that was my next question. Sometimes things are happening out of our control, though.", "and make sure you are not hard on yourself. you' re getting by. you' re hanging in there. you are doing well under the circumstances.", "You get frustrated that other people are achieving something, you are not able to do. Is that a fair understanding?", "Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies?", "they are doing so much things now, you just gotta get on google and see whats out there! i think you are going to be okay, there are definately tough times but you seem to have a grip on knowing what you need. that is great.", "You both can go for a date or do the things what your partner like. Drinking is luring so stay away from that and you can do it.", "One thing I have started doing, since my hair hasn' t been cut for a year due to pandemic, is wearing hats. my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration. Is it long enough to braid?", "I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too!", "Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related.... for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.", "have you put in job applications everywhere.", "yes you can do it. just try.", "I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities.", "I' m sorry to hear that. Feeling resentment for both your husband' s loss of work and your son' s loss of his job is entirely understandable.", "Exactly! You' ve got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you.", "Family comes first. I would do anything to save my marriage as you are doing. I am proud of you. I am pretty sure you both love each other more than anything.", "Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened?", "Hello, what can I help you with today?", "Well, I love fictions and mystery. Right now I just finished\" The Davinci Code\".", "so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.", "Perhaps you havent searched well enough, have you gone to many interviews?", "Take those tools you have, steer clear of her and do your own thing!", "if you did get back together and get married, how do you know he wouldnt cheat again? what if you had kids? they would have to see you go through heartbreak. i think its normal to want to marry your high school sweetheart.", "do not let this bring you down i know you will find a job soon it will just take time and you have to just be patient.", "That sounds bad. Have you considered you might be suffering from depression?", "That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand.", "Same here, wish I could' ve been more helpful but we' re in similar situations and nothing else came to my mind. Hang in there, you' re doing great under the circumstances!", "Is she able to support herself financially?", "I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up?", "you dont have to meet a lot of people, but atleast one or two of your friends with all the safety measures? who could really help you, and also one of the best solution can be group studies as well. My pleasure dear friend.", "I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having?", "This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them.", "That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident?", "You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP?", "I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship!", "I understand that! it is very reasonable to want to be around family and friends during the holidays.", "I Know that in the beginning it' s so difficult to do anything, you just want to sleep and do nothing, but with time you' ll feel much better and try start over.", "I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance..", "I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?", "They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later.", "How long are you doing the online school?", "Having no support is so hard:( Especially during these times!", "its great that you know what you need to do though adn that you know what helps. is there anytihng else you want to talk about?", "Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co - worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective.", "I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don' t be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup?", "your welcome have a good evening to.", "Doing fine, thank you..", "Human being are social creatures by nature so please understand that the feelings that you are having are absolutely normal. So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU.", "You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee.", "How are you tonight?.", "If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after.", "okay, can you press quit first as I am not able to do that from my end:). We can' t end the HIT till you press quit and take the survey:)", "Courage is not the absence of the fear, you should fight to find your place.", "Sounds great. I' m glad you didn' t give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better.", "I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being?", "oh that' s nice. youre welcome!", "You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there.", "Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week.", "I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you.", "I can understand that. I am sorry. Was it different when your children were younger? What has changed?", "Anything particular got you down? Hello.", "Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex.", "Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.", "So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single..", "That is understandable. Was it because of the virus.", "You' re welcome!", "oh sorry for misunderstanding you.", "Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now.", "As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it.", "I know what I am after, just have to be persistent. That is a good choice of study.", "Yeah the virus has stopped a lot of people.", "Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It' s worth a shot!", "Hello! How are you doing?", "Ha, well after two years, feelings had to have changed. Even a little. Does he live nearby?", "that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind.", "I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:(", "That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend?", "Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.", "Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them?", "I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how?", "I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings.", "It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?", "Im hope that i have been able to help at least a little bit.", "Hi, how are you feeling today?", "I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry!", "you can call the store and see if they have anything written by your favorite author.", "I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet.", "Ok, I can tell you are really worried about this and want to find a way to remove the pressure from this situation.", "If you need anything later, just text me.", "Take care!", "Hey, how are you today?", "I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this.", "Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.", "Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?", "i face this situation long time ago i try my best and then i come out easily because i try my best.", "I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money.", "It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct?", "exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year?", "It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything?", "Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation.", "I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....", "It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep. Hope I get it right?", "So you have lost some books? Were they important to you?", "So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.", "Try to tell yourself you are good looking and deserve good things to happen every morning! Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.", "When did this fear start?", "That is why I am here. Is there anything else you would like to chat about?", "Can you tell me more about the fight?", "tell about you? just i chating. what your good name?", "Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends?", "Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression?", "Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.", "It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end.", "Work part - time and go to school part - time.", "In what way does it do that?", "I' m doing good today. What brings you on here?", "I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here!", "Medium only cost 5 a month and you can make money writing about what you have experienced.", "You' re welcome. I wish you the best and many blessings.", "Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but Im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place.", "I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?", "I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic.", "I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest.", "Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?.", "Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods?", "of course! I hope the rest of your year goes well.", "I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you' ll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet.

That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren' t acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them.

Can you tell me more?", "Yes just a moment.", "Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens?

You seem like a good persn.", "If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX( which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing.

Is there more I can do for you?", "To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule.", "Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in.", "It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise.", "just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person.", "And i believe you too are good, as you have realised your mistake, so stop worrying or feeling guilty for the act. Be happy:)", "Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you' ve already attempted to discuss it with? Yeah you' re right.

You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior! Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial.", "Of course, have a great evening!", "oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well.", "I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now.", "Oh I see so right now you' re the main\" parent - er\"?

Have a great day!", "Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.", "Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation?", "Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters.", "I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time?", "It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life.", "I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently.", "Sounds like drunk slander talk. I would let things go for awhile and follow up later.", "Oh.. It' s really sad. But don' t worry. You can explain feelings to her. She may change her mind.", "It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn' t increase along with inflation/ cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially. Of course you' ll need to put your rent and utilities above all else, and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift,", "of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation.", "I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent.", "it happens that you get rejected, but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again:)", "Lovely!", "I hear relaxing music and funny movies can do the trick.", "That' s great!

But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too!", "i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on.", "It does not hurt to try.

Keep your head up!", "Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you' ll try them out.

Do you want to talk more detail about that?", "I' d recommend online message boards.", "It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment?", "That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone.", "Hi. How' s it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself.", "Well that is something:) What are you looking forward to?", "That' s terrific to here. I' m happy you' re feeling better. hear* - sorry for the misspelling.:)", "That sounds like a fantastic idea.", "Do you feel it is more stressful online?", "It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you.

There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled.", "It could be the cause of her behaviour.", "When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it' s better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn' t stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.", "I understand your feelings. If it is a true love, she will also understand your feelings.", "PA got hit hard with the virus.", "Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example.", "I tried really hard not to let her get to me. Which was really hard but doable.", "I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy.

I know that things seem terrible right now but please believe me they will get better.", "Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in?

Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol?", "Keep venting, if it makes you feel better. I know I do when I can talk to someone I don' t know. Is it nice where you are today, so that you can look at something bigger than the indoors?? That often helps me feel better.", "What is it that is making you feel this way?", "It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums?", "I understand, school was tough for me too.

It is very nice of you to have been this patient.", "That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that?", "How long have you been in this long - distance relationship?", "I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed.", "Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma. Are you currently working?", "Sometimes when i have to much free time on my hands i start to feel the same but when i find away to fill the time i no longer feel useless. No problem, I hope you feel better soon!", "I am sorry. What is going on?", "That happens but keep looking. It' s a numbers game, so you have to just apply to a ton them once your resume is ready.", "You too. Have a great weekend!!", "At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now:)", "That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself.

I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to.", "Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days.

I felt good taking the job.:)", "Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern.", "Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.", "i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave?", "You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth. Find common ground, an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you.", "That' s a great idea!", "It may sound cheesy to you,, but making a gift for someone is still one of the best ways to tell someone how much you really care.

That may help to break the cycle of feeling low?", "From what I' ve seen, you' re not alone in that feeling. It' s a natural fear for just about anyone approaching something new.

Do you know when that will be?", "I' m confident that you can handle this and have every faith that you will reach a resolution.", "yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood.

I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer?", "Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It' s really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own.

When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing.

Press the quit button or you will not get paid. I s till will.", "What kind of issues do you think you are having?", "hey how are you doing?.", "I really hope that helps keep you afloat until you can get some real answers.

I got terminated during the beginning of covid.", "Well that sounds very creative! You should definitely publish.", "Hm okay, well I' m sure that if you do propose and organize something for him, even if it is not his favorite thing to do, if he sees that it would make you happy, he will at least consider it don' t you think?", "Ok that' s great! Do you want to tell me more about the issues you are experiencing with him so we can understand a bit more the root of the stress?", "I wish that I could listen to more.... this thing is so slow.

This is all in complete confidence.", "Having a bedtime routine is also another tip. Try to do the same thing every night before bed. Have a consistent bedtime, wake up around the same time everyday, even on days that you don' t have to go to work.
