When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help.

Have you thought about going out and doing that with your friends now?", "Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back!", "Oh, I completely understand. Depression has that effect. But maybe you can talk to your loved ones while in bed? How do you feel about that?", "It sounds like you' re sticking close to your friend, although it doesn' t feel like its helping. It' s my experience that when someone has experienced a traumatic loss like that, making someone feel better, at least right away, isn' t always an option.

Do you feel a bit better about things now?", "Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere. Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with. However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship.... this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn' t feel awkward.", "So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety?

Do you mind me asking what happened?", "I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before. People move on to others and it hurts. They usually are not trying to hurt us though.", "I would be subtle about that tactic.. If you haven' t met any of his school mates. I wouldn' t pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates?", "It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now. I' m also a bit tired but doing OK. What' s been on your mind recently?", "I am Tom.

How may I support you?", "The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I' ve had this happen.

I am happy to listen..", "I understand it can be very difficult at times with parents. Especially since they lived in a life that was very different from today.

Is there something in particular that is leaving you feeling depressed?", "You are welcome. Can I help you with anything else?", "How long have you not been feeling not so well?", "well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?", "i married mine. 3 years later he left me to move into his girlfriends house leaving me with our two month old daughter. trust me, its not worth it in the long run. maybe you can find someone deserving on someone like you!", "I' m very sorry to hear that.

What symptoms do you have and when did it first begin?", "Is there a specific thing or task which is bothering you for long?", "even so you may be able to refer this situation for review to a financial regulator.", "That is an understatement with the politics. What do you do.", "Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don' t support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self.", "it is like there' s a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.", "oh wow. that' s not much of a friendship! So have you attempted at all to discuss it? What does the other friend think about it?", "What about online classes that enable you to study and work also.", "What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!", "Well that sounds as though it will give you something to focus on.", "I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly.", "You' re welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful.", "I also talked to a few friends who are married and had experienced infidelity. They chose to forgive each other. I learned a lot from them. It helped me to make up my own mind as to how I needed to move forward. I didn't want to use a therapist since I do better with discussing ideas with multiple people. But ultimately you may experience a lot of ups and downs. That is also normal. It is your mind and heart processing everything. Please do not get discouraged.", "I read different postings and have over 30 followers.", "things are weird for everyone right now. emotions are running high, covid is running rampant, it' s a mess and understandable that we are all stressed.", "What would you say might be good exercise or reading goals for you?.", "Not in a scary, better - off - dead kind of way, but in the way that a galaxy is a slow moving explosion. I' m a flea to the universe.", "That is very understandable! Setting boundaries for yourself may help. Even when it' s difficult, being clear with your son that you will not be giving him money could help. Sometimes being clear with your own expectations can help him to see what won' t be accepted from him as long as he is living in your home.", "Thank you for reaching out.

I hope you succeed.", "So just to make sure I understand completely, you are ready to move on to the next step of your relationship and you don' t feel as though your boyfriend is and this is making you anxious and upset,.", "It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. Maybe you can write that on your list - - perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends. I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years, it isn' t easy, but it' s part of maturing in life.", "I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc?

I can' t help you if you don' t talk to me darling'", "popularity in my opinion, it' s just an opinion( I hope I make sense) but think about how you' d like to be treated and how you want to feel when you are with someone, because at the end of the day it' s your feelings and your happiness, I wish you the best of luck.", "So you have tried to discuss your loneliness with your husband before?", "I just decided.", "how are you?", "thats hard,.. but you can do it.", "yes.... but my recycling pile has gottene out of hand with amazon boxes. oops lol.", "Think positive my dear friend.

Is there anything else I can help you with?", "bye...", "Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things?", "That' s terrible, I' m sorry to hear that. You' re life isn' t done, it' s just a new start. It' s scary for sure but you have a lot more to you than your ex husband.", "That' s pretty tough. You' re like the 3rd person today who have been going through this,", "Hello, how are you doing today?", "Maybe you could open the discussion with your boyfriend, tell him that you have a date planned over Facetime and you want him to order his favorite dinner, take a shower, do his hair and dress up real nice.", "They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It' s easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc.", "What did she say when you broke up?", "Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/ weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well.", "Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online?", "I' ve had to learn this lesson many times with my own children. It' s difficult, but ultimately will give you some relief from your resentment.", "It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn' t willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right?", "I couldn' t agree more. We will get through this with each others help.", "Just never give up. Two years will go by quickly if you keep attending. Look for grants that will assist you.", "maybe go play some football to get your mind off of it.", "Maybe it can be a good opportunity for her to change her lifestyle and get off the drugs. On that note, I hope I have been able to give you some reassurance and thanks for talking!", "Oh that is so hard. I have family that isn' t taking COVID seriously as well, and its so frustrating to see. Are you able to talk to them about your concerns?", "Are they okay with it when you decline?", "So you feel like they don' t want to be around you and have nobody to talk to?", "I am glad I was able to help!", "Most welcome! Can you press quit first as alas I can' t do it from my end till you have.", "My I suggestion you pick your closest friend, and talk to her/ him about your feeling, but not about your boyfriend, about how you feel your friends have been treating you. Be nice but firm. I bet once they hear your pain, they will be very supportive.", "May not be a fight but she is busy settling in. Does she live with her family.", "No problem. Merry Christmas!", "Search online and locally, get help from your friends and I assure you if you try hard enough you will suceed.", "if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help.", "do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better?", "You know, I once felt the same you are feeling and had the same idea that everyone had their own problems, but I took the courage to seek for help and found out that the people who really care about me will always want to help me.", "I try to read, watch programs or podcasts that take away my negativity.

What do you think may have led up to these feelings of being depressed??", "What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that. For example, I love horror movies, so I joined a horror movie group on Facebook. While it' s not face to face, it is a good opportunity to just connect with others about a common interest.", "That' s a great idea! Just remember to be kind to yourself and take breaks when you need to! Aw, I' m glad!", "I know how you are feeling about that.", "stay strong and stay safe.", "I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.", "I enjoyed chatting with you. Take care.", "I see that, have you tried to talk to your friends about this issue? Or even try a therapist? Maybe you and your Fiance can figure out more times to talk with facetime or zoom. Do a virtual date night.", "I think youre already on the right track. I just know you can get back to you!", "Hmmm, I can see that this is stressful for you. Did you already search for a new job?", "You believe that the girl is not a gold digger, but instead you guys like each other for who you are. Money is not an issue for you guys?", "Why cant you seek help from a friend of yours who studies well? And who is ready to spend time and help you.", "Yes, I also only go out for groceries and work.

I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age?", "With COVID - 19, it may limit your options, but you could decide which activities you would collectively enjoy the most, and try to do them as often as possible together.", "You can try as a school driver. As school now opened You will get it.", "You could try looking online there are a few websites that you could put a resume on and maybe find something that way.", "Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot.", "I often feel the same way when I' m not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive.", "Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key. I hope discussing your work situation today has made you feel a bit better!", "To be honest, here what I feel about you.. you have a lots of good qualities, you are a wonderful person. However, you shortchange yourself. If you can, please start building some self confidence.. Be proud of yourself..

I hope you find resolution and find a way to save your friendship!", "That must feel really isolating.

I had to break down and talk to him about it.", "I am so sorry you are worried about losing your job. I have been in your shoes before. Why do you think your boss wants to fire you?", "Have you seen the serenity prayer? Knowing what to do, what not to do and accepting life really is a great thing to ask God for. We can' t change others. Yet you have to find a way to have peace.", "What is your age?", "Of course. These things are tough to face on your own, so you did the right thing by reaching out. I know you want to be there for your friend as much as possible, and I think that will help you to move through grief at the same time, but just be mindful to not overextend yourself too much.

Totally agree.", "What was the business? It depends on your location but I' m sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose?", "from today please feel yourself that you know everything about your studies, i think then you fell better.", "You as well!", "Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating?", "you' re welcome:) you have to end the conversation from your end because I can' t.", "Would a date night at home with take - out and a movie just the two of you be an option?", "I' m really sorry to hear that.

We just have to deal with them as they come.", "Doing little things every day.", "Of course, that' s understandable..", "very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol. My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can' t get stuck in them.", "I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven' t already done so.", "I can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life.

Some of the best lasting relationships start out as friends with similar interests and then they blossom.", "Did you speak to your friend about it?", "I think if you talk to her again and tell her you are looking out for her best interests it may help open a conversation.

You shouldn' t blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you!

Have you considered you might be suffering from depression?", "That' s not a good spot to be in, I completely understand.", "Same here, wish I could' ve been more helpful but we' re in similar situations and nothing else came to my mind. Hang in there, you' re doing great under the circumstances!", "Is she able to support herself financially?", "I agree. I lost a teacher some time ago and I' ve been thinking a lot about when things might improve. A year seems plausible. Since it' s so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up?", "you dont have to meet a lot of people, but atleast one or two of your friends with all the safety measures? who could really help you, and also one of the best solution can be group studies as well. My pleasure dear friend.", "I' m sorry, what type of problems are you having?", "This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them.", "That can really weigh you down, beating yourself up with guilt. Does he know about the incident?", "You sound quite lethargic. I think you should see a GP?", "I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship!", "I understand that! it is very reasonable to want to be around family and friends during the holidays.", "I Know that in the beginning it' s so difficult to do anything, you just want to sleep and do nothing, but with time you' ll feel much better and try start over.", "I know I am my own worst enemy when it comes to my own appearance..", "I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?", "They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable.

So dont judge yourself or feel as if something is wrong with YOU.", "You sound like you care about this job and that is a valuable asset in a an employee.", "How are you tonight?.", "If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took and that is not right.

I' m glad you didn' t give up seeking for solutions to make yourself feel better.", "I imagine that' s very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well - being?", "oh that' s nice. youre welcome!", "You sound like a very determined person in making this trip as stress free as possible. I commend you for that! Maybe you could have your niece over often to play with your hamster just to soften the stress of being there.", "Sorry to hear that. It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents( around your age) about once a week.", "I think that is useful to remember that we are all human and that most people have been hurt in this way at some point. No - one will be judging you.", "I can understand that. I am sorry. Was it different when your children were younger? What has changed?", "Anything particular got you down? Hello.", "Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex.", "Im sure you can! Maybe write a blog about the repairs you can do to your home, since you are there anyway.", "So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up. In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single..", "That is understandable. Was it because of the virus.", "You' re welcome!", "oh sorry for misunderstanding you.", "Oh dear, yes that can be incredibly hard to deal with. Relationships are so full of emotion that when they end it can feel like chaos or despair. Ive been through a few bad breakups myself in the past so i know how you must be feeling right now.", "As far as I know if we follow a particular time to go to bed eventually We start feeling sleepy at that time or body adapt it.", "I know what I am after, just have to be persistent.

How are you doing?", "Ha, well after two years, feelings had to have changed. Even a little. Does he live nearby?", "that really sucks. Do you have a garden at home? In the mean time, try following youtube or other channels to work out, it helps you distract from current issue and also makes you healthier. A healthy body is needed for a healthy mind.", "I understand but right now is probably not the best time to confront her about it:(", "That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.. Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend?", "Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.", "Why do you say that? Are you focused on trying to get back with them?", "I feel like dying all the time. It' s very common for people to be depressed. Feel ashamed how?", "I know how are you feeling. Im kind of going in the same situation. But you have to keep calm. You have to look things at this way, maybe this is an opportunity to socialize more with your love ones and start learning new things at home. I believe God put us in this situation to appreciate more our surroundings.", "It' s like we live the same life. I also have no car to escape! It seems so small, but it' s such a huge stressor when you feel trapped in an environment you' re not positive in. I feel your pain and I empathize with you completely.. It' ll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?", "Im hope that i have been able to help at least a little bit.", "Hi, how are you feeling today?", "I would feel the same way if that' s a house I grew up in. I' m so sorry!", "you can call the store and see if they have anything written by your favorite author.", "I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures.

I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will. There are a lot of therapy groups available that might be able to help you through this.", "Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.", "Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?", "i face this situation long time ago i try my best and then i come out easily because i try my best.", "I' m actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it?

Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren' t hurting for money.", "It sounds like you feel people think you are complaining when you talk about your Aunt' s death making you sad. Is that correct?", "exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year?", "It' s a really hard time to be finding new work isn' t it? Are you getting unemployment or anything?", "Try meditation as it is able to help you relax and assess your situation.", "I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....", "It seems you are having hard time to fall asleep.

Look in that mirror and tell yourself good things.", "When did this fear start?", "That is why I am here. Is there anything else you would like to chat about?", "Can you tell me more about the fight?", "tell about you? just i chating. what your good name?", "Animals are a wonderful source of comfort when we are feeling very low! Could you join a riding club to make some new friends?", "Depression can be hard to deal with. What do you think is contributing to your depression?", "Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you.", "It is. But trust me, it really helps. I' ve been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don' t have to worry about judgement at all. It' s a hard step but worth it in the end.", "Work part - time and go to school part - time.", "In what way does it do that?", "I' m doing good today. What brings you on here?", "I' ll be around for ages if you want to talk some more on here!", "Medium only cost 5 a month and you can make money writing about what you have experienced.", "You' re welcome. I wish you the best and many blessings.", "Another thing i can recomend is try to read some books. That will help. I dont like reading but Im doing it and sometimes by doing it relaxed me and get me to another place.", "I know this may sound personal, but it is completely normal to have these thoughts though... have you thought about dying at all?", "I can understand how are you feeling. Its not that easy going through this pandemic.", "I feel isolated as well after long time quarantine. It' s like living alone in the forest.", "Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?.", "Well, let me ask you this. I noticed that you had many solutions off - hand that you could tell me, and you also said it could help you with your depression. May I ask what is keeping you from using these methods?", "of course! I hope the rest of your year goes well.", "I think if you really focus on what you need right now, you' ll be able to realize that you dodged a bullet. You don' t want to be with a cheater. you should want to be with someone who respects you and treats you well.", "Just stick to the plan. Spend more time together. Cook dinner for her. Make a strong bond and my best wishes are there for you.", "Don' t worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don' t have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.", "get yourself fixed up and cute, and find a hot new guy. your ex will see on social media and know he messed up and see you happy. its quite theraputic: D", "I would suggest starting with one of those options.. do you have a resume?", "Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped!", "I can understand.", "I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective.", "Those are completely valid feelings to have at this time. Have you considered getting a small reminder of your cat perhaps a small shrine or tribute to him/ her? Her I apologize for the confusion.", "Well, I can tell you that it is hard, but it could be a god send in the long run.", "Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting?", "Just have the confidence within yourselves and believe in YOU, that is the most important thing. Stop worrying, and think about what can make it better.", "Don' t get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There' s always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.", "Any improvement is still improvement!", "I use Medium and now I also have another account with them called Patreon.", "I am sorry for my late reply, i did not hear the chat go off. Ive actually had that same situation happen to me before.", "I used to visit sites that help people who need to find ways to decompress after issues and fights have occurred in relationships.", "Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this.", "yes i can understand that.", "oh gotcha. yeah that is really messed up. how long were you two together?", "Can you tell me what is going on? I should be able to help you.", "It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are?", "Thank you:)", "Absolutely! Being a parent is difficult. Remembering to support yourself helps. Making the time to do things to support your wellbeing doesn' t make you selfish at all.", "What types of things was she texting him about?", "Yes I understand, I' m from the east coast and I' m deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown.", "Ok so you' ve known him for a long time, you two feel comfortable with communicating your feelings and worries together?", "Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside.

What is your main thing to write about besides movies.", "Everyone needs to and everyone forgets too heh.", "I thank you for opening up!", "I' ve worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co - workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs.

What kind of work do you do?", "Have you tried the classified ads? Or check on facebook for a jobs page in your area?", "i understand, but when i had a slight trouble with my job, talking to my manager helped me a lot. also, your manager is your best point of contact for a great reference.", "I feel the same way. I hope you can get things on better terms.", "I understand that completely, I can relate a lot.", "You can end the chat safely now.", "What are you doing? i am john from, new york.", "Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on. That' s good that they don' t push you too much. Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions. I' m sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help... sober fun! Also if you find that you' re struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support. Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking. Maybe look into a group like AA or something similar to share your struggles with others.", "HAve you been searching online sites? They post so many nowadays! If you spend a few hours a day. i' m sure that you' ll find one in no time!!", "Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible.

I hear you, I' ve had to start over again lots of times. but the right guy is out there. Just imagine how bad it would have been if you found out after you moved in with him.

I' ll bet that is difficult to deal with.

You could start practicing soccer again. You definitely have more time for it now. Do you have anyone you can talk to about the break up?

Anything on your mind today?", "Do you think you both might be open to talking to a marriage counselor?", "Is the patient a ward of the state.", "It is incredibly difficult to get something like this off your mind and it seems like you are trying your best to move forward with your life.", "That' s so hurtful. Do others feel the same as you?", "That is completely understandable, there are a lot of overwhelming things going on right now.", "It would be good to do that.

You can find something too.", "That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?. It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this.", "I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can' t live your life in fear, and that they' re going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware.", "Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass. Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of your future and one day it will pay off?", "Always putting money aside when able, and doing lots of research about first time businesses gave a lot of insights.

Do have anything on your mind? Oh i see, well we can talk about that if you like. Has anything happened recently to make you feel this way?", "that' s great!", "Sometimes deep breaths help people calm down. Have you tried that at all?", "Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now. What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing.", "God, tell me more, lol.", "It can seem hopeless right now, but think about how you felt when you were in a better position.", "People are not always who they say they are.", "The mute thing is horrible.

It help me a lot.", "Ah.... relationship worries can be so draining and emotionally exhausting. I can understand that. In your relationship, what has happened to create your worries?", "The job of the therapist isn' t to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It' s to help you understand your feelings and better cope.

Can I suggest something moving forward?.", "that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that!", "I believe there are special lamps that you could get to help.

That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren' t acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are...

We are all finding ourselves spending a lot more time alone than we are used to. Perhaps you could all plan an event for next year when we will hopefully be less restricted.

Can you tell me more?", "Yes just a moment.", "Maybe you can try talking to yoru manager next time it happens?

You seem like a good persn.", "If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX( which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing. I am sure that other places are looking for audio editing. I think Fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work.

If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you.", "Is the friendship more important than the money? That is what it came down to for me.", "have you talked to anyone about it.", "Great, any ideas on what you would like to focus on?", "Is there anything you' d like to talk to me about?", "Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style.", "No, but I' m sure that there is a fitness club or city pool where you all can share your skills.", "I can understand where your coming from with that, especially since this pandemic occurred.", "You listed a lot of good solutions such as zoom and texting.

I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I' ve been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn' t because we grow out of them, it' s quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.", "you too.", "I once had a relationship end after 5 years with a partner. Staying active really helped me get over the relationship. Through that activity I actually met my new partner!", "Of course!

If you every wanna chat again just stop on by!", "was it a common thing that he didn' t give you the attention you wanted?", "Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment?", "Good afternoon.", "Okay, you know I' m here for you. Talk to me, what' s happening?", "hello. you feel sad, why?", "It' s really hard during the Christmas Holidays, but there are ways to decompress.", "I' m sorry to hear that you are sad and anxious.

I understand how you are feeling right now.", "fantastic! that' s a great way to spend your time.", "that' s a great idea, cooking and doing crafts can be helpful for you.

It' s easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow.", "I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that' s bothering you?", "Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis?", "she has a great TED talk!", "You' re welcome:) I have a solution for every problem you know;)", "I have been attending school online, and I occasionally make deliveries for my husband and I' s small business..", "Deep breaths and practicing mindfulness will help you relieve some stress.", "I do it once a week and it really helps.

I, too, am struggling with COVID - 19. It' s going to be difficult not to see family during the holidays. We' ll get through this, though, don' t you think. Have you spent time trying to communicate with friends and family online or by messaging and telephone? Maybe there is a way to find ways to have fun online with your friends and family. We actually played games together recently. Is that something you could do to reconnect?", "also, i think it depends on where you are in the world. covid hit my area really hard around april/ may, but things are completely back to normal now. people hardly wear masks, stores are open, it just takes time.", "ok, don' t worry friend,", "LOL if only everyone had that thought process.

What caused the break up? Was it mutual? Or was it one sided?", "Well I am happy to listen to any problems that you have.", "Remember to always keep a positive mindset. I am sure you will sort this out in no time. Is there anything else I can help you with today?", "I' m sorry to hear that. Are you finding time to do things you enjoy by yourself?

Where do you live.", "how are you? what' s new with you?", "Where are you that you are able to be evicted?

That at least can help you financially until you get a new job.", "I think the best way is to move on.", "Maybe she is busy and the timing is off. Does your friend work.", "Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks. Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep... the amount you drink. Do your friends encourage you to drink more?", "I personally understand how difficult this can be. But if this works out. You can have a good family relationship and maintain a good relationship with your girlfriend. Best of luck!", "Yes! Making lists can be a great idea and help organize some thoughts and ideas you have in your head.", "But what about the family?", "Anytime! It was nice meeting you. Bye - now.", "It sounds like Covid - 19 is going to be a personal stressor for you. It' s such a strange thing to have to live with already, the pandemic, and i' m sorry that it might end up pushing you where you don' t want to be. Could you bring your hamster home with you?

I realise it' s a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though.", "How do you feel about therapy?", "not sure, i can cook myself however the situation pushes me unhealthy choice somehow lol. Btw, it helps for your current mood, does not it? I mean we are talking about other stuffs which make you think about your problem less?", "I wish this virus ends soon.

Someone could have handed them in.", "It sounds like you are trying really hard and that is worthy of praise.", "just remember, yesterday is gone. there is really nothing you can do about the situation. you better keep your distance from that particular person.", "And i believe you too are good, as you have realised your mistake, so stop worrying or feeling guilty for the act. Be happy:)", "Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you' ve already attempted to discuss it with? Yeah you' re right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could' ve never prepared for.", "I have been doing grocery pick - up because of the pandemic, so I sympathize with you.", "I don' t think you' re selfish at all. You have feelings you are entitled to have and are expressing them which is healthy and I encourage that behavior! Good! I know how hard this situation can be. Very nerve wracking. The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial.", "Of course, have a great evening!", "oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well.", "I' m sorry to hear that no good medicine for your issue rite now.", "Oh I see so right now you' re the main\" parent - er\"? Do you have other family that could take the kids for a wekend so you can have a proper rest?", "Do you have any idea of where you lost them?", "I' m sorry to hear that. What has you feeling depressed?", "It sounds like you really care about your friend, and want the best for her. She may not realize this but you are doing the right thing.", "ok for sure, It was nice to talk you.", "Tell me about the situation.", "which vaccine did you get?", "I think you' re supposed to end the conversation btw. Have a great day!", "Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.", "Oh i understand, that would be annoying. Did you talk to your supervisor about this situation?", "Yes, the workplace is not like home life.. Yes, trust matters.", "I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time?", "It sounds like perhaps you should focus your attention on other friends and hopefully eventually this friend will need you for something in thier life.", "I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently.", "Sounds like drunk slander talk. I would let things go for awhile and follow up later.", "Oh.. It' s really sad. But don' t worry. You can explain feelings to her. She may change her mind.", "It is pretty ridiculous how income doesn' t increase along with inflation/ cost of living. Very illogical and crippling to many of us financially. Of course you' ll need to put your rent and utilities above all else, and since the gift you are feeling stressed out about is a parental gift,", "of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable.. You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation.", "I feel that you can be great and be a good entrepreneur..... dog walking doesn' t take a lot of talent.", "it happens that you get rejected, but it is the opportunity to learn from your mistakes and go again:)", "Lovely!", "I hear relaxing music and funny movies can do the trick.", "That' s great! Now you can all go swimming together. Maybe that can be an activity that you all do together a couple times a week.", "don' t think much and keep yourself engaged in the activities you like the most.", "Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use?", "you havve already made it two weeks by going one day at a time.", "It will get better, this is just now and there' s a lot to look forward once you' re through this.

What kind of music do you like?", "instead try googling the phrase\" how to open up to others\" and there should be a few sites with tips and references.", "That is a good idea. I hope that they have not been deliberately stolen.", "Sometimes, to me, the enormity of the universe is calming to my anxiety. Being assured that I mean absolutely nothing is nice sometimes.", "I understand. I have been through a similar situation. Was it a large amount of money?", "I can through our messages that this is a very tough season for you.", "Is Uber an option for you? I know there' s a lot of rideshare services but they' re not always financially reasonable. But that could be a way to get away if you ever need too!", "i can imagine it' s hard to put those feeling into words when you want to move on.", "It does not hurt to try. Maybe call her and tell her you have some things on your mind and could use some advice from her if it is not to much of a bother..", "Happy Holidays Keri. Keep your head up!", "Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you' ll try them out. Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl. Do not be upset about things you can' t control.", "I am so sorry for hearing that. Do you want to talk more detail about that?", "I' d recommend online message boards.", "It is so important during stressful life events to take care of our minds and bodies. It sounds like you have been making good choices! Have you reached out to family or friends for advice or perhaps help with supplemental employment?", "That is very difficult. It is hard to judge things on the phone.", "Hi. How' s it goin'? Are you feeling troubled about something this morning? I know it can be hard to talk about personal problems sometimes. I have a lot of trouble with that myself.", "Well that is something:) What are you looking forward to?", "That' s terrific to here. I' m happy you' re feeling better. hear* - sorry for the misspelling.:)", "That sounds like a fantastic idea.", "Do you feel it is more stressful online?", "It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder..", "I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not.", "I' m glad I could help and I wish you the best of luck!", "Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered?", "I had a bit in savings, but I looked for new jobs mostly. I was on unemployment insurance for about a month before I found a new job. Have you made any plans yet about how to move forward? I can offer some suggestions if you would like. I know about a lot of resources.", "I am proud of the choices you are making and I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control. There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled.", "It could be the cause of her behaviour.", "When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it' s better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn' t stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.", "I understand your feelings. If it is a true love, she will also understand your feelings.", "PA got hit hard with the virus.", "Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example.", "I tried really hard not to let her get to me. Which was really hard but doable.", "I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you' d wish they wear a mask?", "Well, I wish you all the very best for the future. I know that things seem terrible right now but please believe me they will get better.", "Yea, would you consider doing something lesser for now just to make sure you have some income coming in? Or do you still collect unemployment at least?", "That is horrible. Do you mind if I ask why?", "So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you' ve had a reasonable amount of alcohol?", "Keep venting, if it makes you feel better. I know I do when I can talk to someone I don' t know. Is it nice where you are today, so that you can look at something bigger than the indoors?? That often helps me feel better.", "What is it that is making you feel this way?", "It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards. As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums?", "I understand, school was tough for me too.

How are you today?", "yes.", "It sounds like you are doing what you can. It is very nice of you to have been this patient.", "That sounds difficult, Would you like to elaborate on that?", "How long have you been in this long - distance relationship?", "I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed.", "Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma. Are you currently working?", "Sometimes when i have to much free time on my hands i start to feel the same but when i find away to fill the time i no longer feel useless. No problem, I hope you feel better soon!", "I am sorry. What is going on?", "That happens but keep looking. It' s a numbers game, so you have to just apply to a ton them once your resume is ready.", "You too. Have a great weekend!!", "At least you can feel relieved that your daughter is safe now:)", "That sounds very hard. I can understand how judgmental people can be, and of course, why you wouldn' t want people to notice you if it was hard for you to take care of yourself.

Goodnight!", "Try Uber and that is good choice as you are not doing anything.", "It definitely can help.

Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns.", "College finals are a stressful time for sure, I' m sure you' re doing your best to prepare.", "Can you give me an example of something that has been affected recently? For instance, I had been putting off cleaning my house and then some friends dropped by without warning and I was mortified.", "did he admit to it? I would agree that he probably doesn' t feel the way you want him to.", "Well to be honest in some ways your life has been rearranged, but thats okay. Its not EASY, but it is okay, or rather will be okay. experiencing life is just a big bunch of rearrangements that we learn to adapt to and grow from and even out of. Its what gives us depth and character as human beings. HA, well at first i cried and was mad and just moped and hated everything, but eventually i got tired of no getting anything out of my days.

What' s going on at work that' s making you upset?", "Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things.

Have you tried getting outdoors for a small walk or hike?.", "Luckily, there are many platforms online that allow you to work from home. I know of several that allow you to do side\" gigs\". Perhaps you can search and find a few of these. I, myself have had success doing these.", "It' s ok dear. did you asked him why he did that?", "Ah you did not mention that! Maybe for the sake of your child it might be worth going to counselling again then.", "I am so sorry that you had to go through that, I know this is a very difficult time for you. Has your boyfriend reached out to you at all to clarify things or to see if you are okay?", "I' m sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue?", "Started back in to my routine. Work. Church. things like that..", "I think that' s a good call! Do you think you can find a deal somewhere on it?", "It was quite pleasant. And the pay was decent. Plus, I got to read and research a lot. I ended up meeting my wife at the library as well. I felt good taking the job.:)", "Ye. You did the right choice. Safety is always the first concern.", "Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.", "i' m so sorry to hear that. how long ago did they leave?", "You are worth every precious second of time and should not let this diminish your self worth. Find common ground, an activity you all enjoy and invite them to hang with you.", "That' s a great idea!", "It may sound cheesy to you,, but making a gift for someone is still one of the best ways to tell someone how much you really care. You were willing to give of yourself and your valuable time to actually create a gift.", "maybe your boyfriend and your son needs to sit down and have a talk.", "Virginia is hard hit.", "Have you ever tried searching for information about careers in your field?

That may help to break the cycle of feeling low?", "From what I' ve seen, you' re not alone in that feeling. It' s a natural fear for just about anyone approaching something new. But there really aren' t any rules, your life and your decisions decide your success. I' m glad you' re feeling relieved. Your feelings are relevant and completely natural. Just make sure to take care of yourself first and foremost, that' s the most important thing.", "Ok! then we can just wait for the 15 minute mark. Do you know when that will be?", "I' m confident that you can handle this and have every faith that you will reach a resolution.", "yes, it' s true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood. I understand how you' re feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I' m just trying to look at the bright side.", "It defiitely helps me fall asleep. It' s a natural sleep aid.

You seem a very thoughtful person.", "i was upset, but then after thinking about it more, i figured she just was overwhelmed with everything going on. i gave her the benefit of the doubt and texted happy birthday this summer and didn' t hear anything back. can you think of anything going on with her that might cause her to stop communicating?", "Oh Keri, that must feel awful.

I use Zoom, just to see them... do you have a computer?", "Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while. If you have any food insecurity as a result, there are often local food banks. It' s really not something to be embarrased about, so many people face food insecurity through no fault of their own. You could also give a call to your local social services because they will be able to tell you what resources would be available, whether it' s a vocational program or temporary assistance.", "hope I help you somehow.", "I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing. I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more.
